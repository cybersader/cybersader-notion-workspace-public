## Business Terminology

It is important to know certain terminology related to business.  With a small startup it is hard for everyone to know terms that are essential to solving certain business problems.  It is important to know a lot of them.

# My Philosophy

At the heart of a business is the goal to solve some sort of **problem.**
There can be hundreds of solutions to some problem.

## Cover the Problem Surface & Fail Fast

Covering the problem surface sort of refers to the same approach which is taken in cybersecurity.  In cyber, their is a risk surface.  The job of a cyber team is to cover the risk surface as much as possible and to not get distracted by the perimeter or specific nodes within the risk surface.  Better to slightly cover all parts rather than to only focus on a few pieces.

There are many aspects to a problem than just the problem:

- Constraints
- Requirements
- Resources
- Processes

To cover the problem surface means simplifying, optimizing, testing, and engineering the most efficient way possible.  If the problem can’t be perfectly solved, then solve it as best as possible but all while balancing out the aspects of the problem.  

Fail Fast:
This relates to covering the problem surface.  Do not go down rabbit holes for certain problems.  Sometimes do not take too much time in your evaluation of a potential solution.  The technicalities of solving the problem may simply require you to get going and try.  However, always evaluate the risk of failing fast.  Sometimes, a different methodology may be better.

## Process Design - ‘processes are literally everywhere’

Looking at things from a process perspective can help you see how a business must operate.

## People & Collaboration

- Everything can be broken down into processes.  However, we tend to forget that collaborating with people more can often improve parts of the design process that you normally couldn’t with a limited amount of inputs.

## It’s not about money, but about being a steward of your talents

- Do not hoard intellectual property, make a patent, or make a solution more expensive for the purpose of making money.
- Part of the solution is always the monetization model.  However, one should not limit the solutions effectiveness or complicate it just to make more money.
    - Ex: if a solution doesn’t need a membership system and can be solved in a such a way that still has good returns but the user doesn’t have to pay as much and the monetization is good enough to make the solution, then take that route and not one that makes more money.

## Part of the solution means not creating more problems

- Don’t make people work more by sacrificing more important things like family or their relationships.  Doing this will, in the end, subvert the actual solution.
- Don’t exploit humanity to solve a problem.  That means not thwarting the necessities of a good human society.
