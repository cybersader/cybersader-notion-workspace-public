### Home Network Security & Monitoring 🏠 💻 📶

[BenjaminRader.pdf](Research%20Papers%20I%E2%80%99ve%20Authored/BenjaminRader.pdf)

> I discuss the lack of focus on home network security, as most consumers and IT workers perceive the home network as a less appealing or critical target for attackers. This results in poor security and a lack of visibility on home networks, making it difficult to identify and report attacks, not to mention rare. I suggest that implementing solutions for increased visibility on home networks is the first step towards better security, as visibility and "mapping" is crucial for understanding and protecting networks in the corporate and consumer worlds. Various methods for home network security monitoring are presented, supported by research and experience in enterprise security operations. Some of these are obvious, but these practices have not been innovatively adapted into consumer living and home security hygiene.

### Targeted Password Cracking with OSINT Data 🕵️ 🔑 🎯

[Targeted.pdf](Research%20Papers%20I%E2%80%99ve%20Authored/Targeted.pdf)

> This paper discusses the use of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) techniques to curate memorable and publicly available information about a person in order to build targeted wordlists for password-guessing attacks. The paper proposes that the security of memorable passwords relies on the ability of AI models to generate targeted wordlists and the availability of such models to malicious actors. The paper conducts targeted wordlist generation using a traditional manual “permutative” approach and an AI and machine learning approach using 4 public tools. The process uses the author's social media page as an OSINT data source and compares the generated wordlists to an old password using string similarity algorithms. The results show that GPT-3 and OMEN+ wordlist generation underperforms when compared to the a modular permutative approach such as the “Mentalist” GUI-based program. The paper hypothesizes that AI and ML-based implementations are currently more useful for cracking large compromised sets of password hashes and that manual permutative methods are currently more performant in targeted attacks. However, this is only the case if the attacker happens to choose the right combinations of the OSINT data or the user doesn’t use some very personal slang or phrases in their passphrase. The paper concludes that targeted attacks require more sophistication and maturity before becoming a viable method for the average hacker.

### Vulnerable Road Users & Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) Security 🚗 🔒 🤨

[BenR.pdf](Research%20Papers%20I%E2%80%99ve%20Authored/BenR.pdf)

> This paper focuses on the problem of vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as bicyclists, pedestrians, and motorcyclists, who are at a high risk of injury when on the road. Recently, the C-V2X communication technology was introduced to replace DSRC, which has led to multiple industries working together to provide a safer experience for both drivers and VRUs. The paper examines a specific use case called vulnerable road user collision warning (VRUCW) that will be implemented into autonomous C-V2X vehicles. Through research, the paper identifies several wireless security issues that need to be addressed in order to ensure the safety of VRUs. The paper provides solutions to 3 problematic scenarios that may arise when implementing VRUCWs. The first scenario involves issues with non-line-of-sight and other road side unit related path loss / radio interference, vehicle congestion, and denial of service attacks against vehicles at urban intersections. The solution involves better placement of road side units (use 5G or 4G to communicate warnings to autonomous vehicles), designing better channel models, and using the TESLA cryptography method which is cheaper and more performant in an urban setting than PKI (public key infrastructure.) The second scenario involves issues with cameras not covering an intersection fully. The solution involves using additional cameras or sensors on vehicles and dynamically deciding which sensor source to trust via processing at the road side unit. The third scenario involves issues with road side unit failure from factors such as weather damage and power loss. The solution involves using redundant networks of road side units at intersections to handle losses of other units.

### How Personal Security Hygiene Affects Business Cyber Resilience 👤↔ 🏢

[Group6.pdf](Research%20Papers%20I%E2%80%99ve%20Authored/Group6.pdf)

> This research paper discusses how businesses can achieve cyber resilience, the ability to withstand and recover from cyber-attacks. The paper argues that relying on a small team or expensive technology is not enough for a business to be resilient, and that every problem in a business that involves information technology should be solved with a bit of security in mind. The paper posits that if a business can get its employees to think about security more and use it daily, then all the people, processes, and technology in a business can benefit. The research is focused on whether personal security practices, such as using a password manager, legitimately affect business cyber resilience, and is constrained to the 4Rs framework (robustness, redundancy, resourcefulness, and rapidity) and the PPT model (people, processes, technology). The research uses numerous resources, reports, and statistics to show the value of simple habits or adopting new workflows such as using knowledge management software. The paper presents recommendations based on research evidence, and also includes a basic security education training and awareness program to motivate employees to adopt personal security habits.
