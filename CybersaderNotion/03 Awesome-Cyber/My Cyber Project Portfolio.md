## Work Projects 🏢

- Infrastructure Endpoint/Workstation Security Hardening
    - Qualitative risk assessment
    - Pragmatic approach to large-scale hardening efforts and prioritization of risks
- Procurement Pipeline Engineering
- Discovery and visibility efforts in Data Privacy
    - User data lineage and data mapping ← one of the hardest parts about data privacy. I’ve explored the deep and high-level landscape or creating a data mapping process to keep track of user data (where its coming from, where it is processed, and where it is shared or outputted).
    - Custom vendor monitoring and visibility solution with cloud technologies and development using multiple frameworks and languages

## Personal Side Projects 😎

- Cryptography-Based Scavenger Hunt Proposal Game
    - Used Vigenere cipher for symmetric encryption manually along with SHA256 for passphrase checking. All built in Webflow with embedded scripts, animations, and a simply elegant interface.
    - Used a set of physical keys, riddles, ciphers, hashing, and Javascript libraries to lead to a proposal spot for my fiancé.
    - I figured out that there are some niche use cases for seemingly obsolete cryptographic algorithms.
    - Vigenere cipher is virtually unbreable in my implementation because frequency-based cryptanalysis to find patterns is not doable with small ciphertexts.
- Notion to Ghost Blog Converter
    - Created a client-to-serverless proxy-to-API architecture for running decentralized API solutions.
    - Developed a system for converting my knowledgebase content into markdown content for Ghost - a markdown-based CMS (content management system) used for blogging.

## Undergrad Projects 🎓 - University of Indianapolis

- PoseTracker 🏃‍♂️
    - AI-based pose and exercise classification component library that can be used to build mobile applications using React Native. The AI uses the BlazePose pose estimation library combined with some stateful programming, configurable inputs to components, a pose/exercise training system, and the ability to count and track multi-step pose movements or exercises ← there is no other library that has done this yet. Put simply, you could train and count burpees.
- Student Organization Website - Uindy
    - Design, integrations, server-side input validation, basic web development, security, data privacy (notice & policy)
    - Used Webflow, custom native Javascript, and PHP running on an AWS EC2 Apache server.
- GUI Class - (React JS framework)
    - **Cyber Scenario/Kill Chain Builder Game** — precursor to future “Cynario” app/game
        - For my GUI class, I coded a text-based RPG game that is supposed to loosely emulate the cyber kill chain. This could be a really effective and fun way to learn cybersecurity in the realm of education. You can emulate any number of events or scenarios with this method. I coded this using the React JS framework. The magic is in the parsing of JSON objects.
- Co-Author of a Scholarly Article
    - Programmed a discrete fourier transform program in C++.  I literally understood nothing about this level of math, but managed to create a program with another student that did some heavy lifting to process his data.
