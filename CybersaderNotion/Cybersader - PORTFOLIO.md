## KAR Global Desc

I worked on various projects, programs, and initiatives around information security and data privacy. Additionally, I've deployed innovative solutions by leveraging integrations between services with APIs, databases, and scripting. I've even created tools where automation is valuable.

For Information Security, I've conducted qualitative risk assessments over endpoints/workstation computers while utilizing various endpoint-hardening standards. This resulted in a prioritized list of mitigations and an implementation outline. I engineered queries in Splunk and learned the in-depth architecture for how SIEM tools like the ELK stack and Sentinel work. I used lots of other tools too: Microsoft Suite & advanced Excel use, Python, lots of APIs, Kali, Virtualbox, and Docker.

For Data Privacy, I did a lot of the engineering, workflow, and innovation work behind-the-scenes. I helped architect and design new system integrations and large-scale workflow changes to some of our data privacy processes. Namely, I helped engineer processes for cross-departmental collaboration and data sharing via engineered connections between department databases. I added risk visibility to our security and data privacy departments.  I also built tools for personal data mapping efforts, building reports, scanning our various systems for personal data using proprietary tools. 

For the procurement department, I developed a process for processing invoices, automating approval workflows, and saving data in one place. I managed to learn their systems, clean up their database, and develop a complete architecture in about 2 months.
