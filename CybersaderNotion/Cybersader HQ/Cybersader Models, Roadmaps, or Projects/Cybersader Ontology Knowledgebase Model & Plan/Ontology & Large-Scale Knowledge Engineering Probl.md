# Ontology & Large-Scale Knowledge Engineering Problems

- Representing Ontologies to Multiple Knowledge Consumers
- The same problem neuralink tries to solve
- the big problem is communication of reality.  we have limits, our tech to communicate, our senses, or processing power
- traversing ontology models and knowledge structures
- designing systems that are easy to traverse for any problem domain
- ai and nlp to present traversable knowledge structures depending on context and personal ontologies of individuals or collections of individuals
- ignoring ai and oprtimizing nested knowledge and ontology structures for knowledge bases
- designing contributable, sustainable, cultivatable, and growth motivated systems and communites for ontology and knowledge procurement for various problem domains
- making bias resistant bases for ontology and knowledge
- future proof, product lockin proof, fair value, system for knowledge base
- system that encourages knowledge curation and contribution
- system with feedback loop for improving knowledge
- echo chamber resistant system
-
