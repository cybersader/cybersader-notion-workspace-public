# Misc Projects/Ideas/Problems List

Let me give you more examples of problems I'm trying to solve, or projects I'm doing then give me more one-man-team tech and solutions examples and taxonomies:

# Ideas

# Misc Synced

- Plugin that automates Obsidian to 11ty

# Misc

- Graph-based OSINT tool - help with OSINT during engagements
- Curating cyber-related apps, solutions, and platforms
    - comparison
    - contributable system
    - memberships
    - community-driven
- Collaborative Knowledge Base
    - Collaborative Knowledge Management
    - Collaborative Intranet
    - Collaborative Documentation
    - Contribution System that uses GitHub as the backend
- Gpt system that looks at all recently edited notes in obsidian or notion and feeds into git based system that summarizes the days work or things done throughout the day.  You can granularly change what kind of data is summarized or edit the output. feed this into 11ty
- Cynario - a graph based scenario builder client that allows users to build, play, and share graph-based scenarios in a community driven website.  Operates like interactive fiction games.
- WebsiteTechMiner - A little Python project to automate gathering website profiling data from “BuiltWith” & “Wappalyzer” for tech stack information, technographic data, website reports, website tech lookups, website architecture lookups, etc.
- Self-constructing knowledgebase system that uses Obsidian and GPT from OpenAI
- Collaborative and curatable knowledgebase tech and integrations

# Knowledge Base Focused - Curation/KB/KMS

- An open source contributable knowledgebase CMS that allows for sharing of tech stacks, fully managed contributable and collaborative knowledgebase services, integration services, and a system for joining a community of knowledgebasers
- Community for Sharing Obsidian → SSG templates using my Obsidian-as-cms tool
    - System for integrating obsidian vaults in git with any ssg.  templates community around it too.
- Authentication System for KB Contributions
    - System for authenticating users with Oauth to contribute to the obsidian vault and request to make changes.  Web gui that integrates with ssg frameworks to easily allow for a one click solution to contribute or edit a page.
- GPT Obsidian Backlink Finder -
    - AI / GPT that looks through Obsidian notes and finds connections - automatically creating backlinks, or adding in automatic callouts to related notes and subjects.
- Combination Collaborative Contributable Knowledgebase
    - Hierarchical Knowledgebase System that uses child knowledgebases to contribute to a a primary super knowledgebase.
    - Federated system that combines multiple knowledgebases and taxonomies using AI

## Community-Based KB Curation

- Curader io
    - Make a managed system that uses Obsidian as a CMS to feed into an SSG that we provide from curader
    - Develop middleware to let users customize their curation website more
    - Host for free
- Federated Knowledgebase Community System
    - Make a federated system for creating your own websites that host knowledgebase communities

## Notion

- Client-Side program that turns Notion Knowledgebase into knowledge graph

# Cybersader Tech

- Mobile app that hooks up to server.  Records keystroke and app activity and feeds the data in AI models to determine if risky activity was taking place and send periodic reports.  It can report on pornography use and searches, questionable language being used by children, secret code word stuff that teens use, and people stalking or scamming the person.  Can be used as a supplement to Covenant Eyes.

# AI Tools - Information Retrieval, etc.

- GPT-powered secretary that updates you when new tech comes out from various sources, blog websites, youtube, etc.  Can use a tailored GPT prompt for it to web crawl across various data sources, and use the output for other applications
- Web-based AI Taxonomy Notes Crawler and Generator
    -

# CMS

- Obsidian as CMS tools
- Contributable CMS Middleware
    - Allows you to create a git or api based cms between anything uses github or an api to store content, then bridge that to an ssg or js framework using any provided template by the community

# Risk MGMT

## Security Tools

- Benmap - hosted serverless proxy enabled nmap powered service. Means I don’t have to manage the infrastructure, but allow people to easily deploy their own serverless stuff with one-click, so that they only pay for what they use. However I need a system that forces them to atleast pay me one dollar to use the service. Benmap would be a GUI-based system that uses nmap in the background and has a community center to share nmap commands, workflows, etc. Similar to Zenmap
- The problems of comparing SAST Tools and Manual Adjudication of False Positives in SAST.  Design a large-scale program that uses AI to learn between results from multiple tools what are falsebpositives and adjudicate them.

## Data Privacy

- Develop a database like a TPRM platform, and instead track maximum and minimum PII use with software or products.
- Graph-based system for data privacy mapping and data lineage mapping

## Data Engineering

- REST API Data Exporting Client and ETL Tool (RESTPORTER, APIPORTER) -
    - Online REST Client that uses a flexible and configurable CORS header proxy to attach to a REST client that can use JS and provided functionality to transform, search through, and export data from URI REST enpoints. It’s a cool way to export any type of data out of an API
    - You can feed it API docs and stuff like that to generate options and parameters for API calls
    - Can be monetized via Authentication and a system for letting users have a managed servlerless CORS header proxy that we manage.
    - We would need to make a zero trust model so that we can’t see the data
- ETL / Data Privacy & Cybersecurity Data - Smart Attribute NLP Detection Integrator and Analysis tool
    - Take multiple types of data privacy and cyber sources and merge the data for analysis and actionable lists
    - Use a combination of entity resolution and fuzzy matching or fuzzy string algorithms to find matching columns of data between tabular databases or tabular data objects.
    - Used singer and airbyte to handle some of the integrations.
- Centralizing Risk Visibility and Intelligence in Organizations - fuzzy matching, crowdsourced entity resolution, APIs and integrations, architectures and frameworks
    - Fuzzy Matching and Entity Resolution via crowdsourcing verification step
- Desktop text file and excel file matcher and parser.  Takes two sets of files and recursuvely uses jaccard similarity and multithreaded processing and programming to quickly find matches between the needles and haystacks folders.
