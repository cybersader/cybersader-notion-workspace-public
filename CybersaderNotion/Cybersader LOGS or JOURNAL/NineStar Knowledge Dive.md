## Phone Services

### ELEC vs ILEC

ELEC and ILEC are terms that are commonly used in the telecommunications industry to differentiate between different types of telephone companies.

ELEC stands for "competitive local exchange carrier," which refers to a telecommunications company that competes with an ILEC (incumbent local exchange carrier) to provide local phone service in a particular geographic area. These companies often offer lower prices or innovative services to try to win customers away from the incumbent provider.

ILEC, on the other hand, refers to the traditional, established telephone companies that have historically held a monopoly on local phone service in a given area. ILECs typically have an established infrastructure and customer base, but may face competition from newer ELECs.

Overall, the main difference between ELECs and ILECs is that ELECs are new, competitive entrants into the telecommunications market, while ILECs are the established providers with long-standing infrastructure and customer bases.

# Network Engineering Research

It seems like I'll need to learn the following things:

- DSLAM equipment purpose and problem solving around it
- video head-end and special circuits (why are they important? what are they?)
- external ISP network?
- LAN and WAN hardware, software, and networks involved in voice, data, and video (assuming this includes QoS
- Cisco IOS, IOS-XS, and IOS-XR
- Linux kernel and installing things (not sure what TACACS is or why it's important)
- DSLAM providers and servies
- IPTV and how that's important with a small ISP like NineStar
- What are special circuits seriously
- complex network designs (what does this entail?)

To effectively learn and remember the information you need to become a network engineer, you can use various memory techniques, such as mnemonics, visualization, and connecting new information to your existing knowledge. Here's a suggested approach for each topic:

1. DSLAM equipment: DSLAM (Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer) is a device that connects multiple customer DSL lines to a high-speed internet backbone. To understand its purpose, visualize how it brings high-speed internet to individual homes and businesses. Think about the problems that might arise with DSLAM equipment, like connection issues or reduced speeds, and learn how to troubleshoot them.
2. Video head-end and special circuits: Video head-end is the equipment that receives, processes, and distributes video content to subscribers. Special circuits are private, dedicated communication links used by businesses or other organizations. Consider how they're important for providing quality services to ISP customers. Visualize the process of receiving, processing, and distributing video content, and learn about various types of special circuits.
3. External ISP network: This refers to the network infrastructure that connects the ISP to the outside world. Understand the importance of maintaining and upgrading this infrastructure for reliable internet service. Explore the different components involved, such as Linux servers, switches, and databases.
4. LAN and WAN hardware, software, and networks involved in voice, data, and video (including QoS): LAN (Local Area Network) and WAN (Wide Area Network) are networks that enable communication and data transfer. Study the hardware and software components, focusing on their roles in providing voice, data, and video services. Learn about Quality of Service (QoS) and how it helps prioritize different types of data for better performance.
5. Cisco IOS, IOS-XS, and IOS-XR: These are operating systems used on Cisco network devices. Understand their features, differences, and use cases. Practice configuring and troubleshooting Cisco devices using these operating systems.
6. Linux kernel and installing things (TACACS): Learn about the Linux kernel, its role in the operating system, and how to install and configure various Linux programs. TACACS (Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System) is a security protocol used to authenticate users and manage network access. Understand its importance for network security and learn how to set up and manage TACACS.
7. DSLAM providers and services: Research different DSLAM providers and the services they offer. Understand the factors to consider when choosing a provider and how their services can impact the ISP's customers.
8. IPTV and its importance for a small ISP like NineStar: IPTV (Internet Protocol Television) is a service that delivers television content over IP networks. Understand its advantages compared to traditional TV delivery methods and how it can benefit a small ISP like NineStar.
9. Special circuits: As mentioned earlier, special circuits are private, dedicated communication links. Learn about their various types and applications, and practice installing and troubleshooting them.
10. Complex network designs: This refers to the design and implementation of intricate network architectures, such as those involving multiple routers, switches, and firewalls. Understand the principles of network design, including redundancy, scalability, and security, and practice creating and implementing network designs for different scenarios.

As you learn about each topic, try to connect new information to your existing knowledge and use mnemonic techniques or visualization to help remember key concepts. Additionally, practice applying your new skills through hands-on exercises or simulations to reinforce your learning.

# Hiring

## Letter to Hiring Manager

As an IT professional currently located in the Geist area and working with KAR Global (now Openlane), I have had the opportunity to lead various IT-focused projects, meeting company initiatives and contributing to our purpose. However, I am excited to share that I will be relocating to my hometown of Greenfield next month. This move brings me closer to friends and family and now an organization I have come to admire recently: Ninestar Connect.

I've grown up and noticed Ninestar's presence in the community, its name imprinted on signs, sponsoring events, and supporting our schools. However, it wasn’t until I noticed your recent job posting on LinkedIn that I delved deeper into the broad range of services Ninestar offers. I am fascinated by the depth of communications and information systems associated with your services. I can only imagine the satisfaction that must come from working within such a multifaceted, community-focused organization.

My interest in the field of networking was initially sparked by my father, who served in Iraq in 2006 as a network engineer and who now also does cybersecurity like me. His teachings about computers and networking laid the foundation for my own pursuit of knowledge, which I have built upon through networking courses during my undergraduate and master’s studies. However, my interest in this role at Ninestar extends beyond networking.

What truly draws me to this position is the opportunity to be part of a team dedicated to delivering diverse IT solutions. I have always been passionate about the work I do, but my time as a lifeguard taught me the joy of direct community interaction and the gratification that comes from working with a committed team. I see the same opportunity in Ninestar, a chance to positively impact the East Central Indiana community by contributing to the innovative IT systems you employ.

Recently, I contemplated starting a side job in home networking, inspired by the various blogs and YouTube channels I follow. The idea of assembling a team of individuals as passionate about innovation as I am was appealing. However, I realize that such a venture is easier said than done. Coincidentally, Ninestar embodies this very idea, bringing together innovative minds to serve the community in a nonprofit setup. In the case of network engineering, it seems that Ninestar handles the same type of intriguing projects and problems shown in the IT-related media I follow.

One of my favorite groups in cybersecurity is Black Hills Information Security. Their content and classes has been instrumental in my learning IT and cybersecurity. Back in September they were finally having an in-person class nearby in Greenfield! I watched them every day. I went to the two-day class facilitated by Shira Dankner and taught by two of BHIS’s pentesters. The experience was unparalleled as far as cybersecurity classes I’ve participated in, but moreover the Ninestar team made me feel at home. 

In the spirit of honesty, my initial reaction to your job description was apprehension. Yet, the encouragement and guidance of my mentors propels me to seize this opportunity. I am confident that with my skillset, passion, and the potential for growth, I could make a valuable contribution to Ninestar.

I eagerly anticipate the possibility of joining your team and dedicating my efforts to serving the people of East Central Indiana.
