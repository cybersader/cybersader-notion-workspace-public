# The Overview of the Solution

Person:

- Contributable CMS Middleware
Allows you to create a git or api based cms between anything that uses github or an api to store content, then bridge that to an ssg or js framework using any provided template by the community. Essentially its a system that could be turned into an api or give a contribution workflow and custom editor for content between your cms (could be notion or obsidian) and any ssg or js framework.

ChatGPT:

By using Contributable CMS Middleware, developers can create a more streamlined content management process, improving efficiency and collaboration in their projects.

Person:

- This is essentially a system that creating websites that use anything as the CMS, but the other big part is the contributions piece which operates similar to Netlify's Open Authoring. It would allow a link for pages or pieces of content (generated by the middleware system) which allows any webpage viewer to click "edit this or contribute" and they could add content via the original cms (based on the implemented cms, or using a custom editor in the contributable cms middleware interface). A big part of this would then be having authentication for this to identify contributors. The cms middlware system would then also need to save contributor objects too

ChatGPT:

- Contributable CMS Middleware, as described, not only enables creating websites using any CMS but also offers a seamless contribution process similar to Netlify's Open Authoring. To achieve this, the middleware system needs to include several features:
1. Edit/Contribute Links: Generate unique edit/contribute links for each page or content piece, enabling any webpage viewer to suggest modifications or additions.
2. Customizable Editor Interface: Provide a flexible editor interface for contributors, either utilizing the original CMS or using a custom editor within the Contributable CMS Middleware system.
3. Authentication and Authorization: Implement an authentication system to identify and verify contributors before granting them access to edit or contribute content. This can be achieved using OAuth, SSO, or other identity providers.
4. Contribution Workflow: Develop a robust contribution workflow, allowing for content review, approval, and merging. This may include features like pull requests, change tracking, and version control.
5. Contributor Objects: Store and manage contributor data, such as user profiles, contribution history, and access permissions. This information can be used for attributing contributions, managing access levels, and displaying contributor credits on the website.

To implement these features, follow these steps:

1. Create unique edit/contribute links for each page or content piece, making them easily accessible for webpage viewers.
2. Develop a customizable editor interface that either integrates with the original CMS or provides a custom editing experience within the middleware system.
3. Implement an authentication system using OAuth, SSO, or other identity providers to verify contributors' identities and manage access permissions.
4. Design a contribution workflow that allows for content review, approval, and merging. This may include features like pull requests, change tracking, and version control.
5. Set up a system to store and manage contributor data, including user profiles, contribution history, and access permissions.

By incorporating these features, Contributable CMS Middleware can facilitate an open and collaborative content contribution process, while maintaining security and control over content updates.

# Implementation

Person:

- I'm trying to create community-based contributable collaborative knowledge base systems that are scalable and operate similar to that of a CMS. One of the hardest pieces of this puzzle is the collaboration and contribution piece. It essentially needs to operate like a GitHub workflow or at least have a request and merge/verification step that merges the content into the knowledgebase. Not to mention, authenticating the user to attach the change to a name and storing all changes in a system like GitHub is crucial. The only technology I've been able to find that targets this problem is "Open Authoring from Netlify" which seems to use Decap CMS. Do you have any other useful tech or parts of a tech stack or ideas that may help me develop this into a reality. Most likely, I would have a GitHub repo that has content in it (MD from [Obsidian.md](http://obsidian.md/), etc.) and then this content is put into an SSG or some Javascript framework. Any ideas?

Open Authoring Description from Decap CMS:

"When using the GitHub backend, you can use Decap CMS to accept contributions from GitHub users without giving them access to your repository. When they make changes in the CMS, the CMS forks your repository for them behind the scenes, and all the changes are made to the fork. When the contributor is ready to submit their changes, they can set their draft as ready for review in the CMS. This triggers a pull request to your repository, which you can merge using the GitHub UI.

At the same time, any contributors who do have write access to the repository can continue to use Decap CMS normally.

Enabling Open Authoring
Enable the editorial workflow by setting publish_mode to editorial_workflow in your config.yml.

Set open_authoring to true in the backend section of your config.yml, as follows:

backend:
name: github
repo: owner-name/repo-name # Path to your GitHub repository
open_authoring: true
Usage
When a user logs into Decap CMS who doesn't have write access to your repo, the CMS asks for permission to create a fork of your repo (or uses their existing fork, if they already have one). They are then presented with the normal CMS interface. The published content shown is from the original repo, so it stays up-to-date as changes are made.

On the editorial workflow screen, the normal three columns are replaced by two columns instead â€” "Draft" and "Ready to Review".

When they make changes to content in the CMS, the changes are made to a branch on their fork. In the editorial workflow screen, they see only their own pending changes. Once they're ready to submit their changes, they can move the card into the "Ready To Review" column to create a pull request. When the pull request is merged (by a repository maintainer via the GitHub UI), Decap CMS deletes the branch and removes the card from the user's editorial workflow screen. Open Authoring users cannot publish entries through the CMS.

Users who do have write access to the original repository continue to use the CMS normally. Unpublished changes made by users via Open Authoring are not visible on the editorial workflow screen, and their unpublished changes must be merged through the GitHub UI.

Alternative for external contributors with Git Gateway
As noted above, Open Authoring does not work with the Git Gateway backend. However, you can use Git Gateway on a site with Netlify Identity that has open registration. This lets users create accounts on your site and log into the CMS. There are a few differences, including the following:

Users don't need to know about GitHub or create a GitHub account. Instead, they use Netlify Identity accounts that are created on your site and managed by you.
The CMS applies users' changes directly to your repo, not to a fork. (If you use the editorial workflow, you can use features like GitHub's protected branches or Netlify's locked deploys to prevent users from publishing directly to your site from the CMS.)
There is no distinction between users with write access to the repo and users without â€” all editorial workflow entries are visible from within the CMS and can be published with the CMS. (Unpublished Open Authoring entries, on the other hand, are visible only to the author in the CMS UI or publicly as GitHub PRs.)
Linking to specific entries in the CMS
Open authoring often includes some sort of "Edit this page" link on the live site. Decap CMS supports this via the edit path:

/#/edit/{collectionName}/{entryName}
For the entry named "general" in the "settings" file collection

[https://www.example.com/path-to-cms/#/edit/settings/general](https://www.example.com/path-to-cms/#/edit/settings/general)
For blog post "[test.md](http://test.md/)" in the "posts" folder collection

[https://www.example.com/path-to-cms/#/edit/posts/test](https://www.example.com/path-to-cms/#/edit/posts/test)
collectionName: the name of the collection as entered in the CMS config.
entryName (for file collections: the name of the entry from the CMS config.
entryName (for folder collections: the filename, sans extension (the slug).
"

ChatGPT:

- It sounds like you're looking for a solution that combines elements of CMS, Git-based version control, and user authentication. While Decap CMS with Open Authoring from Netlify seems to address many of your requirements, here are a few other technologies and ideas you can consider incorporating into your tech stack:
1. Gatsby or Next.js: Both Gatsby and Next.js are popular React-based static site generators that can be used in conjunction with a Git-based CMS. You can build your knowledge base using either of these tools and integrate it with GitHub for content versioning.
2. Strapi: Strapi is an open-source headless CMS that allows you to create a custom API with a user-friendly interface. Strapi can be used in combination with Gatsby or Next.js for a more flexible content management solution. You can set up custom workflows and permissions for different user roles and integrate it with GitHub.
3. GitLab: GitLab is an alternative to GitHub and offers a similar feature set, including version control and authentication. GitLab allows for greater customization of permissions and workflows, which may be useful in a collaborative knowledge base system. You can create merge requests and manage user roles, similar to the workflow in GitHub.
4. Docusaurus: Docusaurus is a static site generator designed specifically for creating documentation websites. Built on top of React, it supports Markdown content and can be used with GitHub for version control. Docusaurus has built-in support for versioning, so you can manage different versions of your content easily.
5. Auth0 or Okta: These services provide robust authentication and user management solutions. You can use either Auth0 or Okta to handle user authentication and authorization for your knowledge base system. This can be integrated with your GitHub repo or any other part of your tech stack to manage user permissions.
6. [Prose.io](http://prose.io/): Prose is a web-based interface for managing content on GitHub. It provides a simple, user-friendly CMS interface that allows users to edit and create content in a Git repository. Prose can be used in combination with other technologies like Gatsby or Next.js to create a collaborative knowledge base system.

To create your community-based contributable collaborative knowledge base system, you can combine these technologies based on your requirements and preferences. For instance, you could use Gatsby or Next.js for your static site generator, Strapi or Decap CMS as your CMS, GitHub or GitLab for version control, and Auth0 or Okta for user authentication.

Person:

- The problem is that I want to easily have an "edit this page/contribute" button that brings the user to a screen to input authentication options and then edit the page right there on the web or drop in markdown. I have no clue how I would begin to ACTUALLY implement this

ChatGPT:

- To implement an "edit this page/contribute" button with authentication and editing functionality, you can follow these steps:
1. Choose an authentication provider: As mentioned earlier, you can use Auth0, Okta, or even GitHub authentication for this purpose. For this example, let's use GitHub authentication.
2. Implement the authentication flow: Using a JavaScript framework like React, you can implement the GitHub authentication flow to allow users to log in to your website using their GitHub account. You'll need to register a new OAuth application on GitHub and use the provided client ID and client secret. Here is a tutorial to implement GitHub authentication using React: [GitHub OAuth Login in React](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/10/github-oauth-login-react/)
3. Create the "edit this page/contribute" button: Place a button on each content page, which, when clicked, should redirect the user to the editing interface. You can conditionally render this button based on the user's authentication status (e.g., only show the button if the user is logged in).
4. Develop the editing interface: Create a web-based editing interface using React or another frontend framework. This interface can support Markdown editing with a preview option. You can use a Markdown editor library like [react-markdown-editor-lite](https://github.com/HarryChen0506/react-markdown-editor-lite) or [react-mde](https://github.com/andrerpena/react-mde) to create the editor.
5. Connect the editing interface to your CMS/Git-based backend: When the user submits their changes, you'll need to save the edited content to the appropriate file in your Git repository (e.g., GitHub or GitLab). If you're using a headless CMS like Strapi or Decap CMS, you can create an API endpoint to handle these updates.
6. Create a pull request or merge process: After saving the user's changes, you can create a pull request or merge the changes into the main branch. You can use GitHub's or GitLab's API to automate this process, depending on your chosen version control platform. For GitHub, you can refer to the [GitHub REST API documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-rest-api) for details on creating pull requests programmatically.

By following these steps and integrating the chosen technologies, you can implement an "edit this page/contribute" button with authentication and web-based editing capabilities for your collaborative knowledge base system.
