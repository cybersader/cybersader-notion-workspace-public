Making It Our Business to Serve Yours
NineStar Connect provides our members with forward-thinking energy and communication solutions. We’ve got a century of history and experience driving businesses, powering communities, and warming homes to help us do that. And as one of only two American cooperatives to link electric utilities and communications services, we’re constantly looking into the future.

We’re leaders in smart grid use (using IT-based electric power systems), which lets us plan ahead to conserve energy, reduce costs, and greatly increase efficiency. And we’re combining that with our vertical integration strategy, meaning we supply power to our members from sources we own, which positions NineStar to continue to offer competitively priced and reliable energy solutions in Hancock, Hamilton, Henry, Rush, and Shelby Counties for generations to come.

So contact us. We’re a one-stop shop of consulting, services and affordability for your business, whether it’s big or small.
