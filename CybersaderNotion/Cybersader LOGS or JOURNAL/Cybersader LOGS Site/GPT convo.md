## Obsidian to GitHub & Deployment

How would I automatically build and deploy to netlify using this teck stack?

To automatically build and deploy your site to Netlify using the tech stack we've been discussing, you would typically use a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) tool like GitHub Actions or CircleCI.

Here's a high-level overview of how this process would work:

1. You would create a Git repository on GitHub that contains your Eleventy project, including your site templates, content files, and any necessary front-end design system files.
2. You would configure your Git repository to trigger a CI/CD pipeline whenever you push changes to the repository. This could be done using a tool like GitHub Actions or CircleCI.
3. Your CI/CD pipeline would automatically build your Eleventy project whenever changes are pushed to the repository. This would involve running Eleventy to generate your HTML files, as well as any necessary build steps for your front-end design system.
4. Once the build process is complete, your CI/CD pipeline would automatically deploy your site to Netlify. This could involve pushing your built files to a Netlify branch, or using Netlify's API to deploy the site directly from your CI/CD pipeline.

Overall, using a CI/CD tool like GitHub Actions or CircleCI can help you automate the process of building and deploying your site to Netlify, ensuring that your site is always up-to-date with your latest changes.

Could I use serverless functions to do this?

Yes, you could use serverless functions to automate the build and deployment process for your Eleventy site on Netlify.

Netlify provides a serverless functions feature that allows you to run backend code in response to events or HTTP requests. You could use this feature to create a serverless function that triggers the build and deployment of your Eleventy site whenever you push changes to your Git repository.

Here's a high-level overview of how this process would work:

1. You would create a serverless function on Netlify that listens for changes to your Git repository using a webhook. This function would be triggered whenever you push changes to your repository.
2. The serverless function would initiate a build and deployment of your Eleventy site using the Netlify API. This could involve running Eleventy to generate your HTML files, as well as any necessary build steps for your front-end design system.
3. Once the build process is complete, the serverless function would deploy your site to Netlify using the Netlify API.

By using serverless functions to automate the build and deployment process for your Eleventy site on Netlify, you can ensure that your site is always up-to-date with your latest changes, without the need for manual intervention.

Are serverless functions really good for small custom APIs?

Yes, serverless functions can be a good option for small custom APIs. Here are some reasons why:

1. Cost-effective: Serverless functions are billed based on the number of requests and the amount of time the function runs. For small APIs with low traffic, this can be more cost-effective than running a dedicated server or container.
2. Scalable: Serverless functions can scale automatically to handle spikes in traffic, so you don't need to worry about provisioning and managing server resources.
3. Easy to deploy: Serverless functions can be deployed quickly and easily, often with just a few clicks or commands. This makes it easy to iterate on your API and deploy changes frequently.
4. Low maintenance: Because serverless functions are managed by the cloud provider, you don't need to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure or keeping the server up-to-date with security patches.

Overall, serverless functions can be a great option for small custom APIs, especially if you don't want to deal with the overhead of managing a dedicated server or container.

How do I hook up my Obsidian markdown GitHub repo to something like Astro?

To hook up your Obsidian Markdown GitHub repo to Astro, you would need to use a static site generator that supports Astro and can read your Markdown files from your GitHub repo.

Here's a high-level overview of how this process would work:

1. Choose a static site generator that supports Astro: Astro is a new static site generator that allows you to use web components and other modern web technologies in your site. Currently, Astro supports a variety of templating languages, including React, Preact, and Svelte.
2. Configure your static site generator to read your Markdown files from GitHub: You'll need to configure your static site generator to read your Markdown files from your GitHub repository. This will typically involve configuring a plugin or module that can access your GitHub repository and retrieve your Markdown files.
3. Generate your site using Astro: With your static site generator configured, you can now use Astro to generate your site. Astro will use your Markdown files as the content for your site, and will generate HTML and CSS files that can be deployed to a web server or static site host.
4. Deploy your site: Once your site has been generated by Astro, you can deploy it to a web server or static site host. This could involve using a service like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages, or deploying your site to your own web server.

Overall, hooking up your Obsidian Markdown GitHub repo to Astro involves using a static site generator that can read your Markdown files from GitHub, and generating your site using Astro's modern web technologies. With this setup, you can create a dynamic, modern website that's powered by your Obsidian notes.

Show me a textual diagram of how to have Obsidian, GitHub, Eleventy, and Tailwind CSS to make my journal web page architecture

Sure, here's a textual diagram of how you could set up your journal web page architecture using Obsidian, GitHub, Eleventy, and Tailwind CSS:

1. Store your journal entries in Obsidian: You can use Obsidian to write and store your journal entries as Markdown files in your Obsidian vault.
2. Sync your Obsidian vault with GitHub: To make your journal entries available on the web, you can use the Obsidian Git plugin to sync your Obsidian vault with a GitHub repository.
3. Use Eleventy to generate your journal web pages: You can use Eleventy as your static site generator to generate your journal web pages from your Markdown files. Eleventy supports a variety of templating languages, including Nunjucks and Liquid.
4. Use Tailwind CSS for styling: You can use Tailwind CSS as your CSS framework to style your journal web pages. Tailwind CSS provides a set of utility classes that make it easy to create custom designs without writing custom CSS.
5. Deploy your journal web pages to a web host: Once your journal web pages have been generated by Eleventy and styled with Tailwind CSS, you can deploy them to a web host like Netlify, GitHub Pages, or AWS.

Here's a visual representation of this architecture:

Obsidian --> GitHub --> Eleventy --> Tailwind CSS --> Web host

The build step for Eleventy and interfacing that with Obsidian will definitely be the hard part. I'm having trouble figuring out how I would use GitHub actions or a serverless function like Cloudflare functions to automatically use Eleventy and Tailwind to build the site everytime the GitHub repo is changed. I'm also not sure how I will actually bring the GitHub markdown into the Eleventy code at build time.

You're correct that setting up the build process for Eleventy and integrating it with Obsidian and GitHub can be challenging. Here are some steps you can take to get started:

1. Set up a GitHub repository: Create a new repository in GitHub to store your Obsidian Markdown files. You can then use the Obsidian Git plugin to sync your Obsidian vault with this repository.
2. Install Eleventy: Install Eleventy on your local machine using npm or another package manager.
3. Set up your Eleventy configuration: Create a configuration file for Eleventy that specifies how your Markdown files should be processed and how your site should be generated. You can use this configuration file to define custom templates, data sources, and other settings.
4. Write templates for your site: Use Eleventy's templating system to create templates for your journal entries and other pages. You can use templates to define how your Markdown content should be transformed into HTML.
5. Add Tailwind CSS to your project: Install Tailwind CSS in your project using npm or another package manager. You can then use Tailwind's utility classes to style your site.
6. Write a script to build your site: Write a script that uses Eleventy to generate your site from your Markdown files and templates. You can use this script to run the build process manually or automatically using a GitHub action.
7. Set up a GitHub action: Create a GitHub action that runs your build script automatically whenever changes are made to your repository. You can use the GitHub Actions workflow syntax to define the steps in your build process.
8. Deploy your site: Once your site has been generated by Eleventy and styled with Tailwind, you can deploy it to a web host like Netlify, GitHub Pages, or AWS.

Regarding bringing the GitHub Markdown into Eleventy at build time, you can use Eleventy's built-in data sources feature to fetch your Markdown files from your GitHub repository and use them to generate your site. Eleventy supports a variety of data sources, including JSON, YAML, and CSV, so you can use the data source that works best for your needs.

As for using Cloudflare functions, you could potentially use them to trigger your Eleventy build script automatically whenever changes are made to your GitHub repository. You could set up a Cloudflare function that listens for GitHub webhook events and triggers the build process whenever a new commit is made to your repository.

If I don't want to run the build step for the SSG in my own computer, but I want to automatically pull the markdown from GitHub, then use it to build, then how would I do so in the cloud or without doing it on my desktop?

To build your SSG in the cloud without running the build step on your local computer, you can use a cloud-based continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) service like GitHub Actions, Netlify, or AWS CodeBuild.

These services allow you to define a build script that pulls your Markdown files from GitHub, uses them to generate your static site using your chosen SSG, and deploys the resulting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to a web server or static site host.

Here's a general outline of the steps you would take to set this up:

1. Set up your GitHub repository: Create a new repository in GitHub to store your Markdown files.
2. Configure your SSG: Set up your SSG to generate your static site from your Markdown files. This may involve configuring templates, data sources, and other settings.
3. Write a build script: Write a script that pulls your Markdown files from GitHub, uses your SSG to generate your static site, and deploys the resulting files to a web server or static site host.
4. Configure your CI/CD service: Set up your CI/CD service to run your build script automatically whenever changes are made to your GitHub repository. This may involve configuring webhooks, defining build steps, and setting up deployment targets.
5. Test and deploy your site: Once your build script is set up and your CI/CD service is configured, test your build and deploy your site to your chosen web server or static site host.

Different CI/CD services have different workflows and configurations, so the specific steps you'll need to take will depend on which service you choose to use. However, the general approach is to define a build script that runs your SSG in the cloud, and to use a CI/CD service to trigger this build script automatically whenever changes are made to your GitHub repository.

Okay, I'm somewhat understanding the build step now where I take all of the inputs and markdown and templates then generate a site with tailwind too. I'm still not sure how I will actually bring the GitHub markdown into the Eleventy code though. In the end, I will have an Obsidian vault sitting in a GitHub repo, but I need to somehow take that markdown, put it into an Eleventy project, store that in a GitHub repo, then use that at buildtime with Cloudflare or netlify.

To bring your GitHub Markdown into Eleventy at build time, you can use Eleventy's built-in data sources feature to fetch your Markdown files from your GitHub repository and use them to generate your site. Eleventy supports a variety of data sources, including JSON, YAML, and CSV, so you can use the data source that works best for your needs.

Here's a general outline of how you could set this up:

1. Set up a webhook in your GitHub repository that triggers a build whenever new commits are pushed to the repository.
2. In your Eleventy project, define a data source that fetches your Markdown files from your GitHub repository. You can use the **`@11ty/eleventy-plugin-rss`** plugin to parse the Markdown files into an RSS feed, which can then be used as a data source.
3. Use Eleventy's templating system to create templates for your journal entries and other pages. You can use templates to define how your Markdown content should be transformed into HTML.
4. Add Tailwind CSS to your project: Install Tailwind CSS in your project using npm or another package manager. You can then use Tailwind's utility classes to style your site.
5. Write a script to build your site: Write a script that uses Eleventy to generate your site from your Markdown files and templates. You can use this script to run the build process manually or automatically using a webhook triggered by GitHub.
6. Deploy your site: Once your site has been generated by Eleventy and styled with Tailwind, you can deploy it to a web host like Netlify, GitHub Pages, or AWS.

With this setup, whenever you push new commits to your GitHub repository, the webhook will trigger a build process that fetches your Markdown files from the repository using the Eleventy data source, transforms them into HTML using your templates, and generates your static site with Tailwind styling. The resulting files can then be deployed to a web host for public access.
