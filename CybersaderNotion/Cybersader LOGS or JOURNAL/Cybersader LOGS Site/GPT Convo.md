- Based on your requirements and the resources you've shared, you can create a reusable and easily shareable workflow for turning Obsidian into a headless CMS that works with Eleventy. The solution will involve using templates, serverless technology, and one-click deployments. Here's a step-by-step plan to create a reusable workflow:
1. **Create an Eleventy starter template** : Create an Eleventy project that is pre-configured with Tailwind CSS and the necessary plugins and scripts to fetch content from a GitHub repo. Include instructions on how to set up the project and customize it as needed. This template will serve as a starting point for anyone who wants to use Obsidian as a headless CMS with Eleventy.
2. **Create a GitHub repo for the Eleventy template** : Push the Eleventy starter template to a new GitHub repo. This repo will be the source for anyone who wants to use the template.
3. **Create a one-click deployment button** : Create a one-click deployment button for services like Netlify or Vercel. This button will automatically deploy the Eleventy template from the GitHub repo to the chosen service. Here's how to create a one-click deployment button for Netlify and Vercel:
- **Netlify** : Include a `netlify.toml` file in your GitHub repo to configure the build settings. Then, add a "Deploy to Netlify" button to your repo's README. For more information, refer to [Netlify's documentation](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/#deploy-to-netlify-button) .
- **Vercel** : Include a `vercel.json` file in your GitHub repo to configure the build settings. Then, add a "Deploy to Vercel" button to your repo's README. For more information, refer to [Vercel's documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/more/deploy-button) .
1. **Create an Obsidian template for content structure** : Create a template for the Obsidian vault that demonstrates the recommended content structure and naming conventions for files and folders. This template will help users understand how to organize their content in Obsidian to work with the Eleventy template.
2. **Create an Obsidian plugin for GitHub integration** : While the Git Obsidian Plugin already exists, you may want to create a custom plugin that automates the process of connecting the Obsidian vault to a specific GitHub repo. This plugin should also make it easy to configure the remote path for the content folder in the Eleventy template.
3. **Create a comprehensive guide** : Write a detailed guide explaining how to set up the entire workflow, including setting up the Obsidian vault, connecting it to GitHub, deploying the Eleventy template, and customizing the template as needed. This guide will help users get started quickly and ensure they understand all the steps involved in the process.

By following these steps, you can create a reusable and easily shareable workflow that allows users to turn Obsidian into a headless CMS that feeds into Eleventy. Users will be able to use the provided templates and guides to set up their own projects, allowing them to manage their content in Obsidian and automatically build and deploy their websites using Eleventy.

Person:

- Yes, but i need you to help me develop some of these features, develop an eleventy starter with tailwind, and figure out exactly how to connect obsidian with eleventy through fetch. For example, i may need to have a separate repo for the obsidian and the eleventy content. i also assume that eleventy will use fetch to get the content with Github's REST API, but maybe there is a better option. Not to mention, I would like to allow the user to define easily with a one liner in the eleventy template what the root foler is for their daily ot datetime notes. Obsidian has great date time notes but i dont know how to integrate that seamlessly into eleventy since eveything is in folders with a format that might be different. not to mention, i have no clue how to handle the tags thing so that i could show tags for daily or datetime logs, then make some of those crazy features i mentioned.

ChatGPT:

- I understand your concerns and requirements. Let's break down the steps needed to develop the features you mentioned and connect Obsidian with Eleventy through fetch.
1. **Develop an Eleventy starter with Tailwind** :

Create a new Eleventy project and install the necessary dependencies for Tailwind CSS. Follow the guide you shared on [building 11ty with Tailwind](https://5balloons.info/guide-tailwindcss-eleventy-static-site/)  to set up Tailwind CSS in your project.
2. **Connect Obsidian with Eleventy through fetch** :

As you mentioned, you can use GitHub's REST API to fetch content from the Obsidian repo. You can use the `eleventy-plugin-remote-content` or write a custom fetch script like the one mentioned in my previous response.
3. **Allow users to define the root folder for daily or datetime notes** :

You can make use of Eleventy's [Data Cascade](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-cascade/)  to allow users to define the root folder for daily or datetime notes in their configuration file (`.eleventy.js`). For example, users can add the following line to their `.eleventy.js`:

```
module.exports = (eleventyConfig) => {
  eleventyConfig.addGlobalData("obsidianRootFolder", "your-root-folder-name");
};

```

Then, in your fetch script, you can use this global data to fetch content from the specified root folder:

```
const obsidianRootFolder = globalThis.obsidianRootFolder || "default-root-folder-name";
const gitHubAPI = `https://api.github.com/repos/USERNAME/REPO_NAME/contents/${obsidianRootFolder}`;

```

1. **Integrating Obsidian's datetime notes into Eleventy** :

Since Obsidian datetime notes can have different formats, you can allow users to specify their preferred format in the Eleventy configuration file. Use a library like [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/)  to parse the datetime format.

Example: Let the user define their datetime format in `.eleventy.js`:

```
module.exports = (eleventyConfig) => {
  eleventyConfig.addGlobalData("obsidianDatetimeFormat", "yyyy-MM-dd");
};

```

In your fetch script, parse the file names using the specified format:

```
const dateFns = require("date-fns");
const obsidianDatetimeFormat = globalThis.obsidianDatetimeFormat || "yyyy-MM-dd";

// Inside your loop for fetched files
const parsedDate = dateFns.parse(file.name, obsidianDatetimeFormat, new Date());

```

1. **Handling tags** :

To handle tags, you can use [YAML front matter](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-frontmatter/)  in your markdown files. In your Obsidian notes, you can include the tags at the beginning of the note like this:

```
---
tags:
  - tag1
  - tag2
---

```

Eleventy will automatically parse the YAML front matter and make the tags available in the template. You can then display tags for each note and create tag-specific pages using Eleventy's [collections](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/collections/) .
6. **Separate repos for Obsidian and Eleventy content** :

If you prefer to have separate repos for Obsidian content and the Eleventy project, you can do so. The fetch script will still work as long as it has access

Person:

- continue

ChatGPT:

- to the Obsidian content repo using the GitHub REST API. Just make sure to update the API URL in the fetch script accordingly.
1. **Creating a seamless integration between Obsidian and Eleventy** :

To create a seamless integration, consider developing an Obsidian plugin that simplifies the process of connecting an Obsidian vault with an Eleventy project. The plugin should automate tasks such as configuring the Eleventy project to fetch content from the correct GitHub repo and setting up the user's preferred datetime format and root folder.

Additionally, you could create an Eleventy plugin that automatically handles Obsidian-specific features like internal links, backlinks, and block references. This plugin would ensure that the fetched Obsidian content is correctly processed and rendered in the final Eleventy site.
2. **Packaging everything together** :

Once you have developed all the required features and plugins, create a comprehensive guide and template that users can follow to set up their own projects. The guide should include detailed instructions on setting up the Obsidian vault, connecting it to GitHub, deploying the Eleventy template, and customizing the template as needed.

By following these steps, you can create a seamless integration between Obsidian and Eleventy that allows users to easily manage their content in Obsidian and automatically build and deploy their websites using Eleventy. Users will be able to define the root folder for their daily or datetime notes, use tags, and make use of Obsidian's unique features in their Eleventy projects.
