# Understanding APIs

Here's a taxonomy for the underlying components in using a REST API, along with examples and explanations of the difference between the header and body of a request:

- API endpoint: The URL that you use to access the API. For example, the endpoint for retrieving a list of products might be: `https://api.example.com/products`
- HTTP methods: The HTTP verbs that you use to perform operations on the API resources. The most common HTTP methods used in REST APIs are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. Here are some examples:
    - GET: Retrieve a list of products: `GET <https://api.example.com/products`>
    - POST: Create a new product: `POST <https://api.example.com/products`>
    - PUT: Replace an existing product: `PUT <https://api.example.com/products/123`>
    - PATCH: Update an existing product: `PATCH <https://api.example.com/products/123`>
    - DELETE: Delete an existing product: `DELETE <https://api.example.com/products/123`>
- Parameters: Parameters are used to provide additional information to the API endpoint. There are several types of parameters, including:
    - Query parameters: These are used to filter or sort the results of a GET request. They are added to the URL as key-value pairs, separated by the "?" character. For example, to retrieve only products with a price greater than 100, you might use the following URL: `https://api.example.com/products?price_min=100`
    - Path parameters: These are used to identify a specific resource in the API hierarchy. They are added to the URL as part of the resource path, separated by the "/" character. For example, to retrieve a specific product with an ID of 123, you might use the following URL: `https://api.example.com/products/123`
    - Request body parameters: These are used to provide data to the API in the request body. They are typically used in POST, PUT, and PATCH requests. The request body is a part of the HTTP request that carries information from the client to the server. For example, to create a new product, you might send a POST request with the following JSON in the request body:
        
        ```powershell
        {
           "name": "New Product",
           "price": 10.99
        }
        ```
        
        - Header parameters: These are used to provide additional metadata to the API request. They are added to the HTTP headers of the request. The request headers contain additional information about the request, such as the type of content being sent, authorization credentials, or the preferred language for the response. For example, to include an authorization token in the request, you might add a header called "Authorization" with the token value: `Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c`
- Authorization: Authorization is the process of verifying that the user or application making the API request has the necessary permissions to access the requested resource. There are several types of authorization, including:
    - API tokens: API tokens are unique keys that are generated by the API provider and are used to authenticate requests. To use an API token, you typically add it to the Authorization header of the request. For example: **`Authorization: Bearer API_TOKEN`**
    - OAuth2: OAuth2 is a standard protocol for authorization that allows users to grant third-party applications access to their resources without sharing their credentials. OAuth2 works by redirecting the user to a login page where they enter their credentials, and then redirecting back to the application with an access token. The access token is then included in subsequent API requests as an Authorization header. For example: **`Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN`**
    - Response: The API response is the data that is returned by the server in response to the API request. The response typically includes an HTTP status code, which indicates whether the request was successful or not, and a response body, which contains the requested data. The response body can be in various formats, such as JSON, XML, or plain text.
    
    In summary, the header of a request contains metadata about the request, such as the authorization token, while the body of a request contains the data that is being sent to the server. It's important to understand the different types of parameters and how they are used in API requests, as well as the different types of authorization and how they are implemented.
