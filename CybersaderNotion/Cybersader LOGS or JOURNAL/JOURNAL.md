    - Power Consumption Attacks on Data Centers
        - Data centers tend to oversubscribe with their power. In other words, they assume that only a percentage of power is used by each device at one time.
        - Users on VMs in these data centers can run simple Python scripts to cause high power usage on multiple machines (using only VMs) which can cause widespread data center power outages
        - Google is hyper-aggressive when it comes to oversubscription of power
    - Warmonger Attack
        - Serverless Services like with Cloudflare Workers and other FaaS (functions as a service) have a specific attack inherent to egress IP and ports utilized by the server running the serverless function
        - Another tenant of a serverless function can make malicious requests to a target server, which in turn will block the IP of the machine that ran the serverless function. Any other tenants on the machine that runs those serverless functions now gets blocked by that target server
        - These attacks rely on how the SSP (serverless service providers) handle their infrastructure and configuration
    - Cloud Gaming Service Attacks
        - Players can utilize game features and mods to execute malicious code on cloud devices
        - Adversaries can use cloud gaming for non-gaming purposes
        - Steam workshop can be used to inject malicious mods
        - Programs and URLs can be injected into game mods and injected into cloud gaming services
        - Web browsers in the gaming services can be used to execute malicious scripts and visit censored content
        - Defenses:
            - process monitoring, URL request redirection, and adaptive network policies (per game) by using a sandbox for each game to determine what is allowed to be used per game.
    - My own project over Sphinx: a way to implement Homomorphic Encryption and Differential privacy to deep neural networks. AI can be made to be efficient, private, secure, and provably so.
        - Homomorphic encryption could change everything‚Ä¶honestly.
        - Differential privacy is essential to changing how persuasive technology and analytical technology creates conflicts of interest via. user data utilization for its own interests or the interests of the creators of that technology.

    - Looking into developing using a combination of TailwindCSS and AlpineJS, so that most of the interactivity and the styling can be done inline with the markup.
- Exploration
    - Dealing with a loss..of ChatGPT chat history ü§£
    - Curated more random tech solutions
    - Watched videos from web developers that I like to (I do this OFTEN). Some of these include: ‚ÄúTheo‚Äù t3[.]gg, Fireship, and Prime reacts from Twitch.
    - Watched more BHIS Talkin‚Äô Bout Security News.  Great as always. I like taking notes and especially noting that the crazy ideas that come out of these hackers‚Äô mouths.  They are joking a lot of the time, but they are seriously geniuses with some of these ideas.
    - More LinkedIn.  Love seeing new innovative posts, cybersecurity, curations, and great simple ideas that people have.
    - More job searching.

# 3/20/2023

- Work
    - Worked through cloud security alerts
    - Investigation
    - DFIR
    - Not really a takeaway, because it happens all the time:
        - CIS Benchmarked Distributions aren‚Äôt secure if you put them in an insecure network configuration. People may think something is secure because the instance is CIS Amazon Linux 2 Benchmark, when really that‚Äôs only half the battle.  It‚Äôs bad when you put too many open ports of stuff that are public facing. Tons of services can easily be exploited.
- Cybersader
    - More curating and research
- School
    - Lots of research on data acquisition processes for the cloud: volatile acquisition, cloud provenance mechanisms that make logs tamper proof, and different considerations when thinking about cloud-based data acquisition. SLAs, jurisdiction, privacy regulations, and things like cross-border transfers really affect how these sorts of processes take place.
- Exploration
    - Sandboxes and virtualization tech - KASM workspaces.  Heard about it, but haven‚Äôt got to try it out yet. It‚Äôs definitely on the list though.
    - Job searching (past few months)
        - My search is going alright, but there is always the problem of being in my Masters program still and waiting till the semester is over.¬† There are lots of jobs that may be open now, but won't be in another month.¬† Not to mention, some of the jobs won't be able to be as flexible as my current one when my last semester comes around. I should mention that this one was EXTREMELY FLEXIBLE.
        - There are lots of cool ones too, but some are also super underpaid when I find out the salary and stuff. I haven't had nearly as much time to put in the work at starting interviews. Mostly lots of getting the lay of the land and watching what pops up.¬† Some jobs are up for only 2 days which makes me think they must be obligated to put them up or something. Also, remote jobs are ROUGH.¬† There's always like at ~ 1000 applicants, so I don't know what to do with that üòÜ.
    - Looked up research around quantum computing related to cryptanalysis
        - SNDL - store now, decrypt later
    - BlackHillsInfoSec - Talkin Bout News!!!!
        - Brightens up my day.  Working with these people would be one of the coolest things ever. Passionate red teamers who have livened up the cyber field, made people like me interested in it, and inspire others to be heros.
        - They have a great perspective on things. Although, they don‚Äôt seem to understand the area of privacy and how legislation is going here in the United States.
        - There‚Äôs a lot of messed up and good things happening in the realm of privacy. I can‚Äôt tell how it‚Äôll play out and I haven‚Äôt had the time to keep up recently.
    - Development
        - Templating engines - nunjucks, liquid, handlebars, etc.
            - Used with 11ty, but they are cool and useful for automating things like blogs with small projects, where you don‚Äôt need to build a database solution and it‚Äôs generated at build time to static files.
    - GPT was down!!! Seems that it was possible for anyone to access other people‚Äôs chats via their URLs, and so it seems that OpenAI had to quickly build a secure solution for this, since people could start crawling the URLs to scrape peoples‚Äô conversations. I don‚Äôt know for sure if this was the actual reason for their stopping chat history either.
        - ‚ÄúLosing chat history in ChatGPT in 2023 was like losing Wi-Fi connections in 2013‚Äù

    - My idea about a contribution system
        - collaborative knowledge management
        - I'm looking for a contributable headless CMS it seems. I want to be able to have a button on the website that says contribute to this page, you make an account, then you're marked as a contributor somehow on the page.

    - The point of cloud is that we turn computing into a service, but this means we have less control over the hardware and layers close to it.
    - Therefore, how do we ensure we can acquire volatile data like that data stored in random access memory cards (RAM), if we don‚Äôt have control over the hardware?
    - Is this a simple problem or is it more nuanced?
