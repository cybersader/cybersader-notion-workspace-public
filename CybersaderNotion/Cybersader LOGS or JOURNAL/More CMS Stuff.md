## CMS

### With Descriptions

Architecture:

- Monolithic CMS: The CMS is a single, integrated application that handles both content management and presentation.
- Decoupled CMS: The CMS is split into separate content management and presentation layers, allowing for greater flexibility and scalability.

Backend Management:

- Self-Hosted CMS: The user is responsible for managing the backend infrastructure, including the server, database, and software updates.
- Hosted CMS: The CMS is hosted on a third-party server, so the user does not need to manage the backend infrastructure.

Content Delivery:

- Traditional CMS: The CMS generates content on the fly and delivers it to the user's browser.
- Static Site Generator (SSG): The CMS generates static HTML files at build time and delivers them to the user's browser, resulting in faster page loads and improved security.

Client Rendering/Frontend:

- Server-Side Rendering (SSR): The CMS generates HTML on the server and sends it to the client's browser, allowing for faster initial page loads and better SEO.
- Client-Side Rendering (CSR): The CMS generates HTML on the client's browser using JavaScript, allowing for greater interactivity and real-time data.

Hosting:

- On-Premise CMS: The CMS is installed and hosted on the user's own server or data center.
- Cloud-Based CMS: The CMS is hosted on a third-party cloud server, providing easier deployment and scalability.

Programming Language:

- PHP CMS: The CMS is built using PHP, a popular server-side programming language.
- Node.js CMS: The CMS is built using Node.js, a popular server-side JavaScript runtime.
- Ruby CMS: The CMS is built using Ruby, a popular scripting language.
- Python CMS: The CMS is built using Python, a popular high-level programming language.
