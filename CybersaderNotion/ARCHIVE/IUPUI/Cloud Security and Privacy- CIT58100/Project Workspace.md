# Ideation

- Ideas
    - GPT-assisted honey token planter
        - Serverless orchestration system
            - Cloudflare workers
                - Python with wrangler
                - javascript
        - Plants honey entities, tokens, or deceptive data into relational databases when given access to CSP
        - Would it be possible to use some sort of API for cloud service providers that could automatically find databases then test them to see if canary tokens could be used.  Essentially, this means it could look for dbs that it could plant tokens into
    - Deceptive social media and phishing response
        - create fake email accounts and personas
        - utilize canary tokens and fake 
         info for leverage with attackers
        - plant stuff on endpoint for reactive attribution
