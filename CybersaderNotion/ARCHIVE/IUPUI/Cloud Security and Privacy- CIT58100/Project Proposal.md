# Project Proposal

- Objective
    - Explore cloud applications of a cyber deception model
    - Map out and curate the threats that are applicable to cyber deception
    - How it all fits into the cloud layers
    - Deployment and business models for cyber deception
    - Look at infrastructure and topology caveats or implementations
    - Lay out methods and a taxonomy
- Basic techniques/tools/platforms used in the project
    - Explore low level cloud applications and higher level abstraction applications where the user doesn't control as much
    - Techniques:
        - Moving targets
        - Residency cycles
        - Canary tokens and canary implementations
        - Honeypot and honey implementations
        - Attribution Methods
        - Active Defense
- Functionalities of the proposed App/Software
    - I propose a serverless based orchestration system that plants honey entities across cloud infrastructure as more devices are made.
