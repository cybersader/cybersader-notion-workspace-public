# Chapter 8 - Identifying and Analyzing Threats, Vulns, and Exploits

# Types of Assessments

1. Threat
2. Vuln
3. Exploits

# Keys to Risk Management

Risk = Threat x Vulnerability

- Threats will always be there
    - reduce their impact
- Reduce Vulnerabilities
- Exploit Assessments
    - like pentests

# Identifying Threats

What are threats? - the things that can exercise vulnerabilities.

Anything that can subvert or compromise Confidentiality, Integrity, or Availiability. 

## Types

- natural
- physical

## Techniques

- Reviewing historical data
- Performing threat modeling
- Analogy and comparison with similar situations and activities

## Scope

- Scope is important
- This helps cover your risk surface effectively
- Internal vs External

# Threat Modeling

- A process for looking at systems and figuring out threats

# Vulns

- A weakness in IT infrastructure
- Assessments identify vulns
    - servers
    - data
    - personnel

# Threat/Vuln Pair

Threat - Vuln - Threat Action (Exploit)

# Looking for Vulns

Places to look:

- Documentation review
- logs
- vuln sancs
- audits interviews
- process and output analysis
- system testing

# Exploit Assessments

- Proof of concept for vulns
- Pentesting

# Controls

Prevent, Recover, Detect

- Look up NIST controls 800-53
    - helps classify controls

# Cyber Insurance

- Interesting Areas
- A lot of caveats to getting the payouts
- Sometimes you wonâ€™t get paid if it was from nation-state actors
