# Attributed-Based Access Control

# Cryptography based Hierarchical Attributed-Based Access Control

# What is Access Control

- Types
    - Discretionary - owners of resources each determine
    - role-based - predefined roles

# Hierarchical AC

- Attribute-based, but hierarchical relies on some sort of taxonomy?
- Organized into hierarchy based on attributes,
    - or does position in hierarchy assign attributes?

# Attributed-Based Access Control

## What is ABAC?

- Complex conditions are checked per entity for access and transactions.  These utilize hierarchical attributes related to the entity
- Uber hierarchical ABAS
    - scalability and management is easier when having a hierarchical system that doesnâ€™t store every single user-to-resources access rule
    - dual level key management

# Atallahs scheme

- Uses directed acyclic graph to track keys
