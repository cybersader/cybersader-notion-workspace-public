# Homomorphic Encryption

- You can outsource computation (additive or multiplicative) without revealing the data being computed
- RSA is technically multiplicative homomorphic
- Multiplicate homomorphic encryption used a lot less
- Pailier cryptosystem
    - salted
    - additive homomorphic
    - used with e-voting
    - The Paillier cryptosystem is based on the difficulty of the decisional composite residuosity assumption and uses concepts from number theory, such as modular arithmetic and the RSA algorithm.
    - RSA uses p and q
    - You can reuse p and q keys for Pailier
    - The Paillier cryptosystem relies on the fact that it's hard to figure out if a number is a combination of two prime numbers.
- Discrete logarithm problem
    - one direction is easyâ€¦the other is hard
    - One way like a hash function?
    - Find the exponent for which a given number must be raised modulo a prime number
- El Gamal
    - keys that each go one way
    - PKC
    - operates on the fact that DLP is computationally infeasible
    - Sometimes used to transport symmetric keys
    - can be multiplicative homomorphic
