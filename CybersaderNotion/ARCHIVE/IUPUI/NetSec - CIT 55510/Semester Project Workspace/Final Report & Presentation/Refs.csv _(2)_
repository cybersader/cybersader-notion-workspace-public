That means all the traffic transmitted over those networks, including personal messages, passwords, documents and much more, can be easily intercepted and used by attackers.
According to Kaspersky Security Network, 25% of the world’s Wi-Fi networks have no encryption or password protection of any kind. In other words, the information they transmit is completely open and can be read by third parties. Another 3% of hotspots use WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) to encrypt data. This unreliable protocol can be ""cracked"" within minutes using tools that are freely available on the Internet.
The rest of the nearly three-quarters of Wi-Fi hotspots use a more reliable form of encryption based on the family of Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) protocols. The effort required to hack these networks depends on the settings, including the strength of the password. For instance, if it’s a weak or publicly accessible password (e.g., on display in a cafe), a criminal will also be able to decrypt any transmitted traffic.
It’s worth noting that the top 20 countries with the highest percentage of non-encrypted Wi-Fi hotspots includes many popular tourist destinations – Thailand, France, Israel, the US and so on. Travelers are among the most vulnerable because the nearest available Wi-Fi hotspot is often the only way for them to stay connected.

Default, manufacturer-set passwords and poor password security practices continue to fuel passwordrelated attacks on IoT devices. With California’s SB-327 IoT law now prohibiting the use of default credentials, we expect this trend to change direction. Operational misalignment also enables password-targeted attacks.

Firmaster contains seven main functions: password cracking, SSL scanning, web static analysis, firmware update analysis, web dynamic analysis, port scanning and the summary report."

Reports suggest that users often deploy these devices with insecure default configurations, leaving them as easy prey in the hands of malice users. Due to the easy exploitability, these devices have become attackers' paradise. The security analysis of these devices is often overlooked and challenging to undertake because of various versions of custom Linux based firmware and bootloaders they use. The security analysis of these devices holds strategic importance as they act as a gateway to almost every household having access to the internet."

https://www.fkie.fraunhofer.de/content/dam/fkie/de/documents/HomeRouter/HomeRouterSecurity_2020_Bericht.pdf,"routers, statistics",,Perimeter Security,"Figure 3.2 shows the Linux Kernel versions present on the devices. More than 1/3 of the devices
use a kernel version 2.6.36 or even older versions. The last security update for 2.6.36 was provided on February 17th 2011 according to Wikipedia6
. That is 9 years without security patches.
Kernel version 2.6.32 was kind of a long term support (lts) kernel and got its last security update
in 2016. However, none of the evaluated routers used this lts kernel. The oldest kernel version
was found in the Linksys WRT54GL which is powered by a 2.4.20 Linux Kernel released in 2002.
AVM is the only vendor that has not a single device running a 2.6 or older kernel. 46% of AVMs
devices are powered by 4.4 Linux Kernel, which is maintained until today. Nevertheless, more
than half of the AVM devices run kernel versions that are not maintained anymore. Figure 3.2
shows that the other vendors are even worse.
Figures 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 show the known vulnerabilities perspective on this data. As you can see,
even the «best» devices have at least 21 critical or 348 high rated CVEs. The routers are affected
by 53 critical CVEs on average according to our noc rating. The worst case regarding high severity CVEs is the Linksys WRT54GL powered by the oldest kernel found in our study as mentioned
above. There are 579 high severity CVEs affecting this product. The worst cases according the
noc rating are Zyxel NBG6816 and Zyxel NBG6815 affected by 68 critical CVEs.
We refer to our noc rating at this point, because our data shows that critical CVEs according to
CVSS v3.0 rating are not a good rating to compare old software with newer software. Figure
3.4 states that the mean (orange line) of critical CVEs per Firmware in AVM devices is higher
than the mean of all devices, even if AVM uses more recent kernel versions than others. On the
other hand Netgear seems to perform very good, even if half of their devices use a kernel that
was not patched in nine years. This does not sound plausible, but it can be explained easily. As
mentioned above, the CVSS v2.0 does not define «critical» CVEs and older CVEs do not have a
CVSS v3.0 rating. This means even if a vulnerability of an old kernel would be ranked as «critical»
in the means of the CVSS v3.0 rating, it is not part of this statistic. If we have look at our noc or
the high rating, the data is much more plausible.
In conclusion, there is not a single device without known critical vulnerabilities. Another interesting fact is that even if a router was updated in the last year (compare with section 3.1), software
versions known for vulnerabilities were not necessarily replaced by newer ones. Otherwise there
would not be so many devices utilizing a 2.6 Linux Kernel."
