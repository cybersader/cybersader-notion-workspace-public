Legacy signature based anomaly detection techniques are not sufficient anymore as rapid technology improvements lead to new attack schemes.

networks are extremely vulnerable to cyber-attacks. A suitable firewall solution would be of
tremendous assistance in protecting the home network. The home users seek help from ISPs as
previously discussed at great length why the ISP’s role is so important in this whole affair.  ISPs could help a lot with this by giving out certain gateway routers that work for monitoring."

However, VPN products may be confusing for users due to their complexity and user unfriendliness. Fortunately, there existed Wireguard, which is kernel structure of VPN module, that balances in security and ease to use. Embedded system using Raspberry pi armed with VPN Wireguard and equipped with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Suricata being one of the solutions to overcome it. In this study, we tried hardening a Work from home network using Wireguard and Suricata. Combination of ease to use in compact hardware and hardening with Interruption Detection System (IDS) give capability result for operation with 18,7% CPU and 22,7% memory usage and protection with captured 100% event port scanning and exploit."

A virtual simulation of real-life cyber-attack scenarios was carried out. The researcher found that the design was more effective in reporting attacks than the most alternative. The tools allowed the researcher to analyze the detected attacks, visualize them, and correlate them with open-source rules that take further actions against detected intrusions. Although this design requires more than a basic understanding of setting up, the researcher believes that the quality of its effectiveness may spur further research on how SIEM configuration may be made more accessible and straightforward to use to SOHO administrators."
