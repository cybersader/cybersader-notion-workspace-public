# Cyber Security at Home - What Really Matters to People | IEEE Conference Publication | IEEE Xplore

Tags: Home Networks, IoT, Threat Model
Data: There is a myriad of active and completed research on the subject of remote work and the various attack surfaces that it introduces. Users must access their virtual work environments through various processes or network setups. These setups differ from organization to organization just as much as each user’s ”cyber hygiene”

There is no lack of technological means and advice to ensure secure operation of systems, but it is usually people with technical background who define these concepts only/mainly based on technical reasoning. The actual users are rarely figured in, which increases the probability that security measures are not practical.
