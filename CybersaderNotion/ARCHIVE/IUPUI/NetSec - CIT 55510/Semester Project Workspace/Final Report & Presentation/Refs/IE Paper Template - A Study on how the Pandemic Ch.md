# IE Paper Template - A Study on how the Pandemic Changed the Cybersecurity Landscape

Tags: Attacks, COVID, Cybercrime, Home Networks, Work from Home, statistics
Data: The main types of attacks that raised
in popularity during the pandemic are discussed, together with causes, consequences, and mitigation strategies. Our work shows that the most important changes in terms of incidents have
been related to ransomware, phishing, and remote desktop protocol (RDP) attacks. We studied
how COVID-19 restrictions generated the increase in phishing and RDP attacks. Then, to prove
that ransomware was also influenced by the pandemic, we had to validate our hypothesis that
the increase in both RDP and phishing attacks were the main causes of the intensification of
ransomware attacks. We obtained strong correlation indicators which validated our hypothesis.
