Data: No. 2: Password attacks
Default, manufacturer-set passwords and poor password security practices continue to fuel passwordrelated attacks on IoT devices. With California’s SB-327 IoT law now prohibiting the use of default credentials, we expect this trend to change direction. Operational misalignment also enables password-targeted attacks. In many cases, passwords chosen by OT staff are not in line with IT’s more advanced password policies and password management practices. This is one example of organizational misalignment between OT and IT.

Unit 42 found a Gafgyt variant
targeting more than 32,000 potentially vulnerable small office and home wireless routers to conduct a botnet attack against gaming servers on the internet. Today, wireless routers are some of the most common IoT devices in organizations, making them targets for IoT botnets,
degrading both the production network and the reputation of the IP addresses of affected
companies.   

98% of traffic unecrypted
57% of out veulnerable to medium and high attacks
Security cameras and printers make up most vulns
Healthcare medical IoT is not handled well.
