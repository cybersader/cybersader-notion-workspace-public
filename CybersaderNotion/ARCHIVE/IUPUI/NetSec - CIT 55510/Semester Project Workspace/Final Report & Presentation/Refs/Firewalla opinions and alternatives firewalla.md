Desc: Firewalla drawbacks include lack of IKEv2 VPN Server; it includes OpenVPN and Wireguard. I've been testing the Purple for the past couple weeks since receiving it. Overall, it's a good product especially for less savvy folks. I've used pfSense, OpnSense, ipFire, Untangle, and Unifi products, and the purple is the easiest to setup in my opinion.  In short I would say that if you have some networking experience, getting a Qotom or Protectli box with Untangle still represents a better option. If you want something that doesn't require tons of maintenance, works pretty well, and checks most of the boxes, Firewalla Purple or Gold should do nicely as they clearly gear their products towards consumers.
