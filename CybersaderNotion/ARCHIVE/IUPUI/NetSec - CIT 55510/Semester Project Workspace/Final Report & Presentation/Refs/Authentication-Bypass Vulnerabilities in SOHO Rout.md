# Authentication-Bypass Vulnerabilities in SOHO Routers | Proceedings of the SIGCOMM Posters and Demos

Tags: Attacks, Home Networks, Vulns, routers, statistics
Data: Long history of vulnerabilities allowing attackers to breach security and availability of the clients and services on SOHO networks. The results of our study are worrisome: we find a large fraction of misconfigurations and insecurity issues in configuration of SOHO routers, which stand in sharp contrast to the awareness of the security and research communities to the vulnerabilities as well as a large body of work studying related topics.
