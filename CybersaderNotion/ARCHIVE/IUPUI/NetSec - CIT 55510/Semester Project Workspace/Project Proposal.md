# Project Proposal

# Introduction & Background

- 2 notable technological and cultural changes that have occurred in the past few years (domestic and personal domain) :
    - IOT and Smart Home systems
        - platforms, implementations, architectures, technologies, protocols, systems
        - Risk of not getting to market fast enough [seen as] > Risk of developing insecure IoT systems
    - Covid-19 revolutionized work-from-home forever
        - remote jobs on the rise
        - a lot of research on remote work attack surfaces
            - virtual work environments
            - remote access processes and network setups and VPNs
- Work-from-home, remote work, and IoT make home network security much more important now

# Objective of Project

- BRAINSTORM:
    - Answer questions related to personal, consumer, or individual security:
        - Who are the threats?
        - Who are the targets?
        - Are businesses the only targets?
        - How often do attackers leverage or pivot off of the individual and not off of business nodes for modes of attack?
        - Does securing oneself actually help secure businesses?
            - are people more aware?
    - How do we effectively educate people enough about cybersecurity for it to be beneficial?
        - Cost-Benefit ratio of educating people?
            - is it worth it?
        - Who are the threats?
        - Who are the targets?
        - Are businesses the only targets?
        - How often do attackers leverage or pivot off of the individual and not off of business nodes for modes of attack?
    - Is cybersecurity being normalized?
        - Is cybersecurity becoming too siloed from other applicable areas?
        - Are cyber practitioners forgetting about the risk reduction aspect of it?
        - More language, semantics, and buzzwords…maybe even echo chambers
    - Methods to effect and motivate cultural, social, and pedagogical changes to society for better personal security → better cyber security
    - Is the responsibility of personal and individual security at the individual level?
        - What entity has this responsibility? People, governments, organizations that give us routers?
        - Why is the individual or institutional entity responsible?
        - Does the structure of the problem of cybersecurity bring about inherent dilemmas that force this responsibility onto such an entity?
- GENERAL:
    - Overarching objectives -
        - present general recommendations for individuals in the realms of personal cybersecurity hygiene, knowledge procurement or education in cybersecurity, and methodologies in domestic-focused cybersecurity that efficiently reduce cyber risk in diversified problem domains
    - Practical objectives -
        - Assessment of the costs and benefits of educating societies and individuals on personal security hygiene with a focus on home networks
        - Assessment of home network security solutions in relation to remote work, home network activities, and endpoints such as IoT devices.
    - Points of Interests, Caveats, Underlying Questions -
        - pedagogical origins for personal cybersecurity practices and home network security?
            - explain the epistemological and pedagogical (education-related) nature of personal cybersecurity practices and hygiene
        - evaluate and express the risk landscape of personal cybersecurity and define how far the ontology of personal security extends into other areas of cybersecurity
        - In other words, how can we create processes, cultures, and systems that motivate and cultivate better personal cybersecurity practices?
        - Nature of targets of cyber attacks on the home front?
        - Research on:
            - Home Cyber Posture
                - state of network tech that consumers buy?
                - organizations or solutions that control home-to-business remote work interfaces
                - Is the problem one for the end user or consumer to solve?
        - Who is responsible for the home network security of individuals?
        - HOME NETWORK SECURITY

# Scope of Methods and Tools

- Scope / Focus
    - Consumer, personal, and domestic security in the domain of network security
    - Modern home networks
- Methods
    - Threat Modeling of home networks - in relation to remote work, IoT, network topologies, and network security controls
    - Comprehensive investigation of currently marketed solutions for home network security
        - Example characteristics of solutions: workflow and process, consumer acceptance, cyber benefits to organization of individual or place of employment
- Tools, Technologies, and Testing
    - Hot topic attributes for home networks:
        - Devices: endpoints, IoT, routers, switches, modems, printers, access points, etc.
        - ISPs
        - Security Implementations: firewalls, DNS-related controls, and SIEMs??

# Qualitative Assessment

- Risk Assessment of the Modern Home Network
