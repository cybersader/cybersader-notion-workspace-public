# Overview

## Basic

- office hours by email

## Overview

- Security problems
- Grading
- Q&A
- Breif Intro

## Some Scenarios + Basics

Classic basic scenarios

- CIA
    - confidentiality
    - integrity
    - availability
- Know your protocols at the layers
    - Encryption Protocol
        - ECC
        - RSA
        - AES
    - Authentication Protocols
        - Something you have
        - Something you know
        - Something you are
- Layer Models
    - OSI
    - 3 layer

## Basic threat modeling

- Who’s vulnerable?
- Who’s attacking?
- Methods of attack?
- Protection?
- Response?

## Applied Exercises

- Get into the protocols - cryptography
- Sec tools
- Testing different methods and schemes
- Labs and course projects

## Tools and Practice

- Kali / Ubuntu
- Writing scripts

## Grading

- Project
- Reading
- Lab
- Participation

## Labs

- a lot of protocols
- Security tools

## Security Goals

- CIA
    - confidentiality
    - integrity
    - availability
- Non-repudiation
    - someone cannot deny something has been done
    - CYA
        - cover your ass
- Authenticity
    - ENTITY AUTHN: corroboration of the identity of an entity
    - MSG AUTHN: corroboration of the source

## Scope of Network Security

- Communication & Storage
    - both interellated
- Protocols and Algorithms
- We will be focused on the protocols and basic foundations of network security

## Attacks (by goal)

- Confidentiality
    - sniffing
    - copying
- Integrity
    - redirection
    - MITM
- Availibility
    - DDOS
    - disruption
- Non-repudiation
- Authenticity
