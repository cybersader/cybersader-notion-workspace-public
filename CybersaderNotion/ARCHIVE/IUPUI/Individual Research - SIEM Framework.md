# Topic Ideas

- Log Management & Event Visibility
    - SIEM framework
    - Architectures
    - Frameworks
    - Taxonomy
    - Consumer friendly architectures and solutions
- Phone Scams
- Verifiable Identity or MFA without Revealing Personal Information
    - Lots of systems rely on things like phone numbers that are hard to get multiple of

# Project Proposal

- Log management framework that takes the deepest principles into account such as computation storage hardware and then extrapolates it up into higher abstracts and accounts for things like the SaaS and IaaS models
- Also accounts for other features such as persistentness bring the stream bass stateless / storage list process of the pipeline
- Also takes into account the effort and cost-effectiveness from the view of the provider of Siem and stream-based processing services
- Also takes into account time that is needed to develop and/or realize the architecture
- Mainly look at innovative combinations of tools or software, and or looks at open source solutions and text stacks for the solution
