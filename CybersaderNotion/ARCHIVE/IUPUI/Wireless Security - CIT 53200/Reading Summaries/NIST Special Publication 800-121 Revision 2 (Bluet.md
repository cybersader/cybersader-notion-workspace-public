# NIST Special Publication 800-121 Revision 2 (Bluetooth)

# Reading 2 Assignment

This is a NIST standard and it is a long document. What we will practice is how to read and understand the structure of such a standard document. I don't expect that you will read all 67 pages but quickly understand how to find certain info in this doc. And you can pick one subsection of technical details and focus on that for the summary.

Write a one page review summary for this paper. Include 4 parts:

(1) state the problem the paper is trying to solve,

(2) summarize its main contributions,

No need for "evaluate its strengths and weaknesses," for this NIST paper

(3) suggest at least two interesting open problems on related topics (that is not discuss in our class)

(4) tell me if anything was too difficult to understand
