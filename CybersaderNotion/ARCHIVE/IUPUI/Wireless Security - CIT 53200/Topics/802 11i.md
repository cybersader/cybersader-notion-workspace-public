# Authentication & Key MGMT

- IEEE 802.1x
    - port security for APs
    - Blocks all traffic on a port-by-port basis
        - until client is authenticated by keys stored on AP
- Key-caching
    - stores info from devices on the network
    - this is how phones reconnect without having to log back in after roaming or leaving the building

## Pre-Authentication

- Allows user to roam
- uses key caching on AP and key stored on client device

## Wi-fi Security Models

- WPA - personal & enterprise
- WPA2 - personal & enterprise

## Personal vs Enterprise

- Personal
    
    ![Untitled](802%2011i/Untitled%201.png)
    
    - PSK - preshared key
    - sharing of keys is done manually
    - guest access is difficult
- Enterprise

    - Authentication Server
        - Typically a RADIUS (remote auth dial in user service) server
            - central DB for users
        - OTHER
            - SQL, LDAP, Microsoft AD

# Public Key Encryption

## History

- Diffie and Hellman in 1976
- proposed in 1970 by James Ellis
- Diffie Hellman used for key distribution systems
- Digital signature
    - widely used

## Public Key Encryption Algorithms

- Most use modular arithmetic number theory or elliptic curves
- RSA
    - based on factoring large numbers
- El Gamal
    - discrete logarithm
    - same idea as diffie hellman

## Diffie Hellman Key Agreement Protocol

![Untitled](802%2011i/Untitled%203.png)

- Asymettric keys
- Different hard problems used with DH
    - discrete log
    - computational diffie hellman
    - decision diffie hellman
