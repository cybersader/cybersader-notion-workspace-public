# Overview

- Wireless Technology + Wireless Security
- Vulns related to wireless networks
- **NOT** a cryptography course - thank the lord
- cryptography gives constraints and properties to wireless security, but it does not need our attention to be useful
- **NOT** a conceptual or theoretical course
- TODOs
    - play with tools
    - design and test wireless security schemes

## Wireless Security

Basic 5 Questions:

- Who‚Äôs vulnerable
- Who‚Äôs attacking
- Different methods of attack
- Mitigations, Protections, Remediations
- Incident Response
