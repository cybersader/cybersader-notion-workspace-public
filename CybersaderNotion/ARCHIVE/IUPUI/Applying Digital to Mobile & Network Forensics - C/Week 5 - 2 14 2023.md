# GPT Q&A

## How are kernel-code/interrupt handlers, interrupts, kernel mode, forensics, and write blockers related?

Kernel code and interrupt handlers are components of an operating system's kernel, which is the core of the operating system. The kernel is responsible for managing system resources, including the CPU, memory, and input/output devices. Interrupt handlers are functions within the kernel that are executed in response to hardware or software interrupts.

Interrupts are a mechanism for signaling the CPU to pause its current task and perform a different, usually higher-priority, task. Interrupts can be triggered by hardware events, such as a key press or mouse movement, or by software events, such as a system call. Interrupts are typically handled by the kernel and can cause the CPU to switch to kernel mode, where it has higher privileges and access to system resources.

Forensics is the practice of gathering and analyzing digital evidence in order to investigate and solve crimes or other incidents. Write blockers are hardware or software tools that prevent data from being written to a storage device. They are commonly used in forensic investigations to ensure that the data on a storage device is not modified during the investigation.

All of these concepts are related in that they are all part of the inner workings of a computer system. Interrupts and kernel mode are important components of the operating system's functionality, while kernel code and interrupt handlers are the mechanisms that enable the operating system to respond to these events. Forensics and write blockers are related in that they are tools and practices used to investigate digital systems, including those that use interrupts, kernel mode, and kernel code. When conducting digital forensics, it is important to use write blockers to prevent data from being modified, which could corrupt the investigation.

## What is interrupt 13 and how would it be applicable to forensics?

Interrupt 13 (INT 13) is a software interrupt used in the BIOS of a computer system to perform low-level disk operations, such as reading or writing to disk sectors. It is used by the operating system to communicate with the hard drive and other storage devices.

In terms of digital forensics, INT 13 can be useful for analyzing and recovering data from a compromised or damaged hard drive. For example, if a hard drive has been infected with malware or has suffered physical damage, it may be difficult to access data stored on the drive. INT 13 can be used to access specific sectors on the hard drive and attempt to recover data that may be hidden or damaged.

Additionally, INT 13 can be used to perform a low-level disk copy or image of a hard drive. This can be useful for forensic investigators to create a bit-for-bit copy of the hard drive without modifying the original data. By creating an exact copy of the hard drive, investigators can conduct a thorough analysis of the data on the drive without risking damage to the original evidence.

It is worth noting that in modern operating systems, such as Windows and Linux, direct access to the hardware via INT 13 is typically not allowed due to security concerns. However, INT 13 may still be used by certain tools and software applications designed for digital forensics and data recovery.

## Does Kali Linux (Forensics Mode) block interrupt 13? If not, how does it relate to Forensics Mode anyway?

Kali Linux is a popular Linux distribution that is commonly used for digital forensics and penetration testing. Kali Linux's Forensics Mode is a boot option that is designed for forensic investigations, where the primary objective is to preserve the integrity of the evidence.

As far as I know, Kali Linux's Forensics Mode does not block INT 13. However, the Forensics Mode is designed to create a read-only environment that does not modify the original data. This is accomplished by mounting the target file system as read-only, disabling swap space, and not starting any unnecessary services or daemons.

By creating a read-only environment, Kali Linux's Forensics Mode helps to ensure that the original data is not accidentally modified or corrupted during the investigation. This is essential in forensic investigations, as any changes to the original data could compromise the integrity of the evidence and potentially make it inadmissible in court.

## How does the OS mount something as read-only?

In an operating system, mounting a file system as read-only means that the file system can be accessed for reading, but writing to it is not allowed. This is typically done to ensure that the data on the file system is not modified, intentionally or unintentionally.

To mount a file system as read-only in a Linux-based operating system, the mount command can be used with the "-o ro" option. For example, the following command can be used to mount the /dev/sda1 partition as read-only:

```
bashCopy codemount -o ro /dev/sda1 /mnt
```

This command will mount the /dev/sda1 partition at the /mnt mount point and allow it to be accessed for reading, but writing to it will not be allowed.

In Windows, mounting a file system as read-only can be accomplished by changing the file system's properties. To do this, right-click on the drive or partition that you want to mount as read-only, select "Properties," and then check the box next to "Read-only." This will prevent any changes to the files or directories on the drive or partition.

It is worth noting that mounting a file system as read-only does not provide complete protection against modifications to the data on the file system. For example, a user with root/administrator privileges may still be able to modify the data, and certain types of malware may be able to bypass read-only protections. However, mounting a file system as read-only is a useful tool in preventing accidental modifications to the data during forensics investigations and can be a valuable component of a larger forensic strategy.

## Is the drive safe when plugged into the host machine? In other words, can the data on that evidence drive be modified immediately when plugged in? Is there a way to ensure that it isn't in this Bootable Kali Forensics Mode situation?

When a drive is plugged into the host machine, there is a risk that the data on the drive could be modified, either intentionally or unintentionally. For example, if the host machine has malware or a virus, it could infect the evidence drive. Or, if a user accidentally deletes or modifies files on the drive, it could compromise the integrity of the evidence.

To minimize the risk of modifying the data on the evidence drive when it is plugged into the host machine, forensic investigators can take several precautions, such as:

1. Use a **hardware write-blocker**: A hardware write-blocker is a device that physically blocks write commands from being sent to the evidence drive. This ensures that the data on the drive cannot be modified while it is connected to the host machine.
2. Use a **software write-blocker**: A software write-blocker is a software program that blocks write commands from being sent to the evidence drive. This can be a useful option if a hardware write-blocker is not available.
3. Mount the evidence drive in **read-only mode**: As we discussed earlier, mounting the evidence drive in read-only mode prevents write operations to the drive, and can help protect the integrity of the evidence.
4. Use a **bootable forensic USB drive**: A bootable forensic USB drive, such as Kali Linux in Forensics mode, can be used to analyze the evidence drive without modifying the data on the drive.

In summary, while it is possible that the data on the evidence drive could be modified when it is connected to the host machine, forensic investigators can take precautions to minimize this risk. Using a write-blocker, mounting the drive in read-only mode, or using a bootable forensic USB drive are all viable options to help protect the integrity of the evidence.

## Why does Kali need to be bootable on a USB to prevent writes to the evidence?

When Kali Linux is booted from a USB drive, it creates a self-contained environment that runs entirely from the USB drive. This means that the operating system, applications, and user data are all stored on the USB drive, and nothing is installed or modified on the host machine's hard drive.

Because the Kali Linux environment is running entirely from the USB drive, it is possible to mount the target drive in read-only mode, as we discussed earlier, without the risk of accidentally modifying the data on the drive.

In other words, by booting Kali Linux from a USB drive, forensic investigators can create an isolated, read-only environment that allows them to analyze the evidence drive without modifying the data on the drive.

If Kali Linux were installed directly on the host machine's hard drive, it would be more difficult to ensure that the evidence drive is not modified. Even if the evidence drive is mounted in read-only mode, there is still a risk that the operating system or other applications installed on the host machine could inadvertently modify the data on the drive.

By using a bootable Kali Linux USB drive, forensic investigators can create a clean, isolated environment that is specifically designed for forensic investigations and helps to ensure the integrity of the evidence.

## Not using bootable Kali or write blocker can cause modification of evidence drive - What are some examples of cases where this can happen with, for example, a USB drive of evidence attached to a host machine?

There are several scenarios where evidence on a USB drive could be inadvertently modified when it is attached to a host machine. Here are a few examples:

1. **Automatic software updates**: Many operating systems and applications automatically check for and install software updates. If the host machine is set to automatically install updates, it could modify system files or other data on the evidence drive.
2. **Background processes and services**: The host machine may have background processes or services that are running and accessing data on the USB drive. These processes or services could modify the data on the drive, even if it is mounted in read-only mode.
3. **User error**: It is possible for a user to accidentally delete or modify data on the evidence drive, even if they do not intend to. For example, a user might accidentally drag and drop a file onto the evidence drive, or delete a file by mistake.
4. **Malware or viruses**: If the host machine is infected with malware or a virus, it could infect the evidence drive and modify the data on the drive.
5. **Virtual memory**: The host machine may use virtual memory, which is a portion of the hard drive that is used to supplement the computer's RAM. If the evidence drive is mounted on the host machine, it is possible for virtual memory to be used to cache or swap out data from the evidence drive, which could potentially modify the data on the drive.

These are just a few examples of how the data on an evidence drive could be modified when it is attached to a host machine. To minimize the risk of unintentional modifications, forensic investigators should take precautions, such as using a write-blocker or mounting the drive in read-only mode. Additionally, using a bootable Kali Linux USB drive, as we discussed earlier, can help to create an isolated, read-only environment that is specifically designed for forensic investigations and can help to ensure the integrity of the evidence.
