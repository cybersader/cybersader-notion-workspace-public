## Scope

### Project Proposal

- Passwords are prevalent - primary method for authentication
- Passwords are relatively safe when they are long
- With NLP, deep learning, neural networks, and AI are passwords still safe from brute force cracking simply because of length and not being on a well-known wordlist?
- Choice of passwords depends on a lot of variables
    - language, context, strategy for remembering it, etc.
- Password choice has patterns
- Hypothesis:
    - modern natural language processing allows us to crack passwords that were previously seen as unbreakable.
    - methods for cracking can be improved by using OSINT data with NLP models
    - OSINT DATA: social media, email, websites, account, previous passwords, etc.
    - generate wordlists from OSINT data
