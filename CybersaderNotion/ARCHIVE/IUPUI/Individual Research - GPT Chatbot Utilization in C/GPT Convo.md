# GPT Convo

Person:

- Could I create a specialized chatbot with GPT3 that utilizes a web or desktop-based GUI to train the model over unstructured text from lists of URLs that I feed it? I want to specialize this chatbot in cybersecurity. Does web scraping have limits? Would I be able to design and build this training GUI along with the chat UI in Python?
- How could I make all this in Python while having an input or variable to control rate limiting?
- Show me Python code for a GUI-based Python GPT 3 training, saving, and chatting/prompting interface.
- Show me, without any GUI implementation, how to train a GPT 3 chatbot on unstructured text in Python.
- Are there other options for GPT models that can act like chatbots that are just as "smart" as GPT 3 or ChatGPT?
- How many approximate articles would I have to train GPT 3 on to fine tune it enough to answer cybersecurity questions?
- Is there a way I could use NLP to produce huge sets of search queries that are related to a specific domain, in which I could feed data from the search queries into GPT 3 model training.
- How would extract relevant topics or generate related search queries to train the chatbot on? How would I do this in Python?
- I want to design a ML and GPT/AI-based program that I can feed URLs, extract topics and/or prompts from the textual data, create specialized search queries or GPT prompts for that topic (this means prompts for GPT or search queries for Google), perform search queries or GPT prompts, then extract more topics from the returned search results of GPT answers, and so on. This means that the process will be recursive. I want to have control over the recursiveness, how many topics it expands on, and how many times the whole process is repeated
- Is it a bad idea to tell the GPT model to essentially learn by itself with this recursive approach?
- Would it prevent overfitting if I use GPT to simply generate search queries, but train it on what those online search queries return?
- I'm confused about whether I would simply tell the GPT model "generate a search query based on this large amount of data", or would I summarize the data using the GPT model, and then tell it to generate based on that textual data? I'm just confused about how you get a GPT model to generate search queries. Can one literally command the GPT model to do things? Is that generally how you can use them as a programmatic piece of the training workflow?
- Can you explain some of those other techniques?
- What different ways could I use to create a GUI-based application to ease this whole process? I might want to have a cloud-hosted, self-hosted, and desktop option.
- Can you do web development with Python or not really?
