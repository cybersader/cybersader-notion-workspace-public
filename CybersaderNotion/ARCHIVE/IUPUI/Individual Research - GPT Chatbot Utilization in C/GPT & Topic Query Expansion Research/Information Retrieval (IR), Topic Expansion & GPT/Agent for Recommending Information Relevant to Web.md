the gist: During things like Zoom there is differing amounts of understandings with participants during the discussion. Consensus building is limited as a whole during discussion. An agent was developed to recommend information related to discussion as it happens. The agent somehow obtains discussion text during discussion, then information is recommended via a real-time search. Query words for the search are generated with a pre-trained query-term-generation model. A separate model is used to classify the data obtained during search.
