https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667096821000021,,"To overcome the weaknesses of current web system and to utilize the strengths query expansion a novel framework based on fuzzy ontology is proposed for information retrieval. In the proposed framework, domain specific knowledge is utilized for ontology construction. In framework pre-defined domain ontologies and Global ontology, ConceptNet is used to construct a fuzzy ontology. Based on constructed fuzzy ontology most semantically related words for a query are identified and query is expanded. A fuzzy membership function is defined for different semantic relationships present among the Global ontology ConceptNet.
Based on the proposed framework queries are expanded (Semantic query expansion) and evaluated on four popular search engines namely Google, Yahoo, Bing and Exalead. The performance metrics used are Precision, Mean Average Precision (MAP), Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), R-precision and Number of documents retrieved. The Web search engines are precision oriented. Based on the proposed framework all the metrics are improved approx. by 10%. Precision before the query expansion lies between 0.75-0.81 whereas after the query expansion lies between 0.85-0.89 on various search engines. The number of documents retrieved is almost improved 1/1000 after the query expansion.","- Semantic Web

Several approaches have been proposed in the literature, and some of them are considered as yielding state-of-the-art results in Information Retrieval. In this paper, we explore the use of text generation to automatically expand the queries. We rely on a well-known neural generative model, OpenAI’s GPT-2, that comes with pre-trained models for English but can also be fine-tuned on specific corpora. Through different experiments and several datasets, we show that text generation is a very effective way to improve the performance of an IR system, with a large margin (+10 %MAP gains), and that it outperforms strong baselines also relying on query expansion (RM3). This conceptually simple approach can easily be implemented on any IR system thanks to the availability of GPT code and models.","- GPT-2

In this position paper, we examine this hypothesis, identify strengths and limitations of both LMs and KBs, and discuss the complementary nature of the two paradigms. In particular, we offer qualitative arguments that latent LMs are not suitable as a substitute for explicit KBs, but could play a major role for augmenting and curating KBs.","- KB (knowledge bases)
