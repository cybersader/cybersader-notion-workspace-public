# The Idea

- Design a modular desktop or web-based GUI to train, save, and utilize a GPT 3 model as a Cybersecurity-focused chatbot
- General architecture
    - USING PYTHON:
        - Web scraping
            - BeautifulSoup, Scrapy for web scraping
            - Rate Limiting -
                
                There are several ways to implement rate limiting in a Python script for web scraping:
                
                1. Using sleep: One simple way to implement rate limiting is to use the **`time.sleep()`** function to pause the script for a certain period of time between requests. For example, you could add **`time.sleep(2)`** between requests to limit the rate to one request per 2 seconds.
                2. Using a rate limiter library: Python has several libraries that can be used to implement rate limiting, such as **`ratelimiter`** and **`backoff`**. These libraries provide more advanced rate limiting options, such as setting a maximum number of requests per second, or implementing an exponential backoff algorithm.
                3. Using a variable: You could also create a variable that keeps track of the number of requests made in a certain period of time, and only allow a certain number of requests before pausing the script. For example, you could set a maximum number of requests per minute and check the variable after each request, pausing the script if the maximum number of requests has been reached.
                4. Using a header: Another way to implement rate limiting is to include a **`Retry-After`** header in the response from the server, which tells the client how many seconds to wait before making another request.
                
                It's worth noting that different websites may have different rate limiting policies and you may need to experiment with different rate limiting methods to find the one that works best for your use case.
                
        - GUI
            - PyQt, Tkinter, wxPython
        - GPT
            
            ```python
            import openai_secret_manager
            import transformers
            
            # Get the API key for the OpenAI GPT-3 model
            secrets = openai_secret_manager.get_secret("openai")
            api_key = secrets["api_key"]
            
            # Use the GPT-3 model from the transformers library
            model = transformers.OpenAIForCausalLM.from_pretrained("text-davinci-002", api_key=api_key)
            
            # Get the text data you want to use for training
            text_data = "Here is the unstructured text that you want to use for training the chatbot"
            
            # Define the number of training steps and the batch size
            n_steps = 100
            batch_size = 1
            
            # Use the train() method to fine-tune the model on the text data
            model.train(text_data, num_steps=n_steps, batch_size=batch_size)
            
            # Save the fine-tuned model
            model.save_pretrained("model_dir")
            ```
            
- Multiple inputs:
    - Model - selected from file system if you want to use an already trained model
    - URL list - csv, text, or even sets of search queries
    - User prompt - prompt, question, or command from user to be used to generate output from chatbot
- Web scraping with URLs
    - Use rate limiting
- Choices of models
    - GPT CAVEATS
        
        The quality and quantity of the data that you use for training the chatbot will have a significant impact on its performance. If you only use a small number of articles, the model may not have enough information to accurately answer questions related to those articles. Additionally, if the articles are not representative of the topic or domain you want the chatbot to specialize in, the model may not learn the relevant information.
        
        With a small amount of data, it's likely that the model will not perform well. The larger and more diverse the dataset is, the more knowledge the model will have to generalize and respond to different situations.
        
        However, if the articles are very high quality and are specifically related to the topic or domain that you want the chatbot to specialize in, then it's possible that the model will be able to generate reasonable responses even with a small number of articles.
        
        It's also important to note that GPT-3 has been pre-trained on a vast amount of data so it's possible to fine-tune it with a small dataset and still have reasonable performance. However, the performance of the fine-tuned model will be better if you have a larger and more diverse dataset.
        
    - Model Solution Landscape
        
        Yes, there are other GPT models that can be used to create chatbots, some of them are:
        
        - GPT-2: GPT-2 is a pre-trained language model that was released by OpenAI in 2019. It's similar to GPT-3 in terms of capabilities, but it has a smaller number of parameters, which means it requires less computational resources to fine-tune it.
        - DistilGPT-2: DistilGPT-2 is a "lite" version of GPT-2, which has been distilled to have 40% fewer parameters while still preserving the performance of the original model.
        - T5: T5 is a pre-trained text-to-text transfer model, which can be fine-tuned for various natural language processing tasks, including chatbot. It was introduced by Google in 2020.
        - CTRL: CTRL is a pre-trained model that can generate text conditioned on a control code, which represents the task the text should be relevant to.
        
        All these models are available in the transformers library and can be fine-tuned for a variety of tasks, including chatbot, with a similar level of performance as GPT-3, depending on the data and fine-tuning process.
        
        It's worth noting that the choice of model depends on the specific use case and the computational resources available. GPT-3 is the largest and most powerful of these models, but it also requires the most computational resources to fine-tune and use.
        
- Gathering data to train models
    - Use curated URL lists
    - Use a search query generation approach
        - Use NLP techniques to identify keywords and phrases related to the specific domain. For example, you could use techniques such as text mining, latent semantic analysis, or topic modeling to extract relevant keywords and phrases from a set of seed texts.
            
            To extract relevant topics or generate related search queries to train a chatbot, you can use the following methods in Python:
            
            1. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) or Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA): These are topic modeling techniques that can be used to extract topics from a corpus of text. In Python, you can use libraries such as gensim and scikit-learn to perform LSA or LDA and extract topics from text data. Once you have the topics, you can use them to generate search queries. For example, you could use each topic as a keyword to generate a set of search queries.
            2. Text mining: Text mining is the process of extracting relevant information from unstructured text data. In Python, you can use libraries such as NLTK, spaCy, and gensim to perform text mining tasks, such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization, which can be used to extract keywords and phrases from the text. These keywords and phrases can be used to generate search queries.
            3. TextRank: TextRank is an unsupervised algorithm that can be used to extract keywords and phrases from text. In Python, you can use the PyTextRank library to perform TextRank. Once you have the keywords and phrases, you can use them to generate search queries
            
            Here is an example of how you could use Gensim's LDA model to extract topics from a corpus of text and generate search queries:
            
            ```python
            import gensim
            from gensim.models import LdaModel
            from gensim.test.utils import common_corpus, common_dictionary
            
            # Define the text corpus
            text_corpus = ["This is the first text document.", "This is the second text document.", "This is the third text document."]
            
            # Convert the text corpus to a bag of words representation
            dictionary = Dictionary(text_corpus)
            corpus = [dictionary.doc2bow(text) for text in text_corpus]
            
            # Train the LDA model on the corpus
            lda_model = LdaModel(corpus, num_topics=3, id2word=dictionary)
            
            # Print the topics
            for topic in lda_model.print_topics():
                print(topic)
                # Extract keywords from the topics and use them to generate search queries
                keywords = [word for word, _ in lda_model.show_topic(topic[0])]
                search_queries = [" ".join(keywords)]
                print(search_queries)
            ```
            
    - Designing a Topic Expansion system:
        - The idea is to feed a custom program that I build URLs of articles or papers in a specific cyber domain, extract potential topics and prompts from the textual data (using topic modeling or another technique), and then expand on those topics via more specialized search engine queries. I can call this "naive topic expansion" or something of the like. Then the GPT model is trained on those topics. This would focus more on the specialized training of the model. I understand that evaluating effectiveness could also be quite difficult if not impossible. Most of these results will probably require a more qualitative approach for evaluation.
        - I want to design a ML and GPT/AI-based program that I can feed URLs, extract topics and/or prompts from the textual data, create specialized search queries or GPT prompts for that topic (this means prompts for GPT or search queries for Google), perform search queries or GPT prompts, then extract more topics from the returned search results of GPT answers, and so on. This means that the process will be recursive. I want to have control over the recursiveness, how many topics it expands on, and how many times the whole process is repeated
            
            It is possible to design a machine learning and GPT/AI-based program that performs the process you described. Here's an overview of how you could approach it:
            
            1. Use web scraping techniques to extract text data from the URLs you feed into the program. You could use a library such as BeautifulSoup or Scrapy to extract the text data from the HTML of the web pages.
            2. Use NLP techniques to extract relevant keywords, phrases, or topics from the extracted text data. You could use libraries such as NLTK, spaCy, or gensim to perform text mining tasks and extract relevant information from the text data.
            3. Use the extracted keywords, phrases, or topics to generate specialized search queries or GPT prompts. You could use different variations of the keywords and phrases, and add Boolean operators such as "AND" and "OR" to generate a diverse set of search queries or GPT prompts.
            4. Perform the search queries or GPT prompts and extract more text data from the returned results.
            5. Repeat steps 2-4 a certain number of times, depending on the level of recursiveness you want to achieve.
            6. Use the extracted text data and topics to fine-tune a GPT-3 model for the specific domain you want to specialize in.
            
            The process of this program could be controlled by several variables, such as the level of recursiveness, the number of topics it expands on, and how many times the whole process is repeated.
            
            It's worth noting that this process will require knowledge of web scraping, NLP, GPT-3 fine-tuning and Python programming. Additionally, it's important to follow the web scraping best practices such as respecting the website's rate limits and terms of service.
            
        - In step 2 or 3, how could I use a GPT model to generate more GPT prompts and more search queries? In other words, instead of using variations of extracted keywords and phrases, I want to use another separate GPT model or maybe even the same one that I'm training to generate specialized search queries or more GPT prompts.
            
            Using GPT to generate search queries and then training the model on the text data returned by those search queries can be a good approach to prevent overfitting. By using GPT to generate search queries, you are introducing diversity and variability in the data you are using to fine-tune the model, which can help to prevent overfitting.
            
            Here's an overview of how you could approach it:
            
            1. Use GPT to generate a set of specialized search queries based on the keywords, phrases, or topics you have extracted from the text data.
            2. Perform the search queries and extract the text data from the search results.
            3. Use the extracted text data to fine-tune the GPT model.
            4. Repeat steps 1-3 a certain number of times, depending on the level of recursiveness you want to achieve.
            
            It's also worth noting that, depending on the amount of data you are able to collect, it could be a good idea to split your data into a training and validation set, and perform fine-tuning on the training set and evaluate the performance of the model on the validation set to monitor overfitting.
            
            It's important to keep in mind that this approach of using GPT to generate search queries and using the search results to fine-tune the model may depend on the domain and the quality of the data returned by the search queries. It's also worth noting that, depending on the amount of data you are able to collect, it could be a good idea to split your data into a training and validation set, and perform
            
        - How would I perform step 1? I'm confused about whether I would simply tell the GPT model "generate a search query based on this large amount of data", or would I summarize the data using the GPT model, and then tell it to generate based on that textual data? I'm just confused about how you get a GPT model to generate search queries. Can one literally command the GPT model to do things? Is that generally how you can use them as a programmatic piece of the training workflow?
            
            In order to use a GPT model to generate search queries, you can use the GPT model to generate text that is similar to the format of a search query.
            
            Here's an example of how you could use a GPT model to generate search queries:
            
            1. Prepare a prompt for the GPT model in the format of a search query. For example: "Generate a search query for finding information about [keyword]"
            2. Input the prompt into the GPT model and get the generated text as output.
            3. Extract the search query from the generated text.
            
            Alternatively, you can use the GPT model to generate a summary of the data and use that to generate search queries. Here's an overview of how you could approach it:
            
            1. Prepare a prompt for the GPT model to summarize the data. For example: "Summarize this large amount of data about [topic]"
            2. Input the prompt into the GPT model and get the generated text as output.
            3. Use the summary generated by the GPT model to identify important keywords and phrases.
            4. Use the identified keywords and phrases to generate search queries.
            
            It's worth noting that in both examples, the GPT model is not "performing" the task of generating search queries, but rather generating text that is similar to the format of a search query. The extraction of the search queries from the generated text is done by the user. Additionally, it's important to keep in mind that the quality of the search queries generated by the GPT model will depend on the quality of the data used to fine-tune it and the quality of the prompt.
            
            It's also worth noting that GPT models are not designed to perform specific tasks as you command, but to generate text based on the input provided to them. GPT models can be used to generate text, but you will need to extract the search queries by yourself and evaluate their quality. Additionally, you may want to consider other techniques such as clustering, topic modeling or even rule based approaches to generate search queries.
            
        - What are some other techniques that I could use to generate search queries?
            
            Sure, here are a few examples of other techniques that you could use to generate search queries:
            
            1. Clustering: Clustering is a technique used to group similar data points together. You could use clustering to identify groups of keywords and phrases, and then use the keywords and phrases in each group to generate search queries. For example, you could use the K-means algorithm to cluster the keywords and phrases, and then use the centroids of the clusters as the search queries. In Python, you could use libraries such as scikit-learn or Pyclustering to perform clustering.
            2. Topic modeling: Topic modeling is a technique used to extract topics from a corpus of text. You could use topic modeling to identify topics in the text data, and then use the topics to generate search queries. For example, you could use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) to extract topics from the text data, and then use the topics as the search queries. In Python, you could use libraries such as gensim or scikit-learn to perform topic modeling.
            3. Rule-based approaches: A rule-based approach is a technique that uses a set of predefined rules to extract information from text data. You could use a rule-based approach to extract keywords and phrases from the text data, and then use the keywords and phrases to generate search queries. For example, you could use regular expressions to extract keywords and phrases from the text data, and then use them as the search queries. In Python, you could use libraries such as NLTK or re to perform rule-based approaches.
            
            These are a few examples of techniques you could use to generate search queries, but there are many other techniques that you could use depending on the specific task, complexity and nature of data. It's important to experiment with different techniques and evaluate their performance to find the best approach for your specific use case.
            
            Yes, you can do web development with Python. Python is a versatile programming language and can be used for a wide range of tasks, including web development. There are several web frameworks available for Python that make it easy to create web applications, such as Flask, Django, Pyramid, and Tornado. These frameworks provide a set of tools and libraries that allow you to handle common web development tasks, such as routing, handling HTTP requests, and working with databases.
            
            Flask and Django are two of the most popular web frameworks for Python, Flask is a micro framework and it's lightweight, easy to learn and good for small projects and prototypes, while Django is a more robust and full-featured framework, it's great for large-scale and complex web applications.
            
            Additionally, Python has a great ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that can be used for web scraping, web scraping, handling data and other web development related tasks. For example, you could use BeautifulSoup, Selenium, Requests and Scrapy for web scraping, pandas and NumPy for data analysis, and PyMySQL, sqlalchemy and ORM libraries for database management.
            
            It's worth noting that web development requires knowledge of web technologies, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as a good understanding of web standards and best practices, and also a good understanding of security and data privacy.
