# Topic/Query Expansion and Recursive Web Crawling or Corpus/Dataset Generation

> I'm trying to figure out terms that I can search or query online to figure out more about the following topic. I'm trying to design a system that can use GPT-3 to generate search queries for web crawling and training a GPT model to create a specialized chatbot. I want to give the user who is training the GPT model the ability to define search queries or describe what they want to train on. I want the GPT model to then generate potential search queries for the user based on a list of URLs that it is fed or based on search queries it generates. Essentially, I'm trying to create a web crawling and training system that revolves around ideas of recursion and expansion. I've also heard phrases that describe this process as "query expansion", "topic expansion", etc. At the core, I want to design a cross-domain, cross-language, recursive, flexible, and controllable process for repeatable information retrieval and query expansion that can feed training data into a domain-specific specialized GPT model that can be utilized by internal teams in organizations.

- Web Crawling and Scraping
- Text Data Extraction
- Web scraping and crawling techniques
- IR and NLP techniques for query generation and suggestion
- Techniques for training and fine-tuning language models on specific domains or topics
- Corpora construction
- "gpt-3 query expansion"
- "information retrieval query expansion"
- query reformulation using gpt-3
- gpt-3 based search engine
- gpt-3 for web scraping"
- "web crawler" AND "threat intelligence”
- “web crawler” AND “GPT”

## Traditional Query Expansion Methods

- Synonymy expansion: adding synonyms of the query terms to the original query
- Polysemy expansion: adding different meanings of the query terms to the original query
- Hierarchy expansion: adding broader or narrower terms of the query terms to the original query
- Textual-thesaurus expansion: using external knowledge sources such as a thesaurus or ontology to add related terms to the original query
- Pseudo-relevance feedback: using the top retrieved documents to identify and add new terms to the original query

## Related Topics

- Query reformulation: the process of modifying a user's query to make it more effective in retrieving relevant documents.
- Query understanding: the process of understanding the intent and meaning behind a user's query, which can be used to improve the effectiveness of search results.
