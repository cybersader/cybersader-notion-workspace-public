# Shortform

- 
- The “I've got nothing to hide” argument
    - The first type is the criminal
        - They've got everything to hide and are actively being investigated or looked at, so anything is useful against them
    - The second is the value rich target
        - They've got money or something of value and personal data is just another way for specific entities to target and exploit them of that value
    - The third is most people
        - They aren't being tailed and they aren't huge targets
    - So why does data privacy matter for that third group.
    - Real talk, we are in a society with growing connectivity, and more and more companies are valued because of their ability to grab you. Companies are competing for change in your future and behavior.
    - Companies use your personal data to buy your futures and to change you
    - Companies exist to lend to some goal or some interest, and data privacy exists because of this…
    - Companies can exploit people by using their personal data to have some form of control over their futures
    - Data privacy does things like making consent necessary for these companies to have more control
    - So why does data privacy matter?
    - If you have goals, then you should care about how your data is used to affect those goals whether directly or indirectly. These companies use personal data in ways that will affect them.
- 3 essential personal cyber resilience items you should already have
    - Email aliasing
        - Defends against cred stuffing and entity resolution
        - Makes email filtering way easier
        - Use addy forward mail and privacy
    - Password manager
        - As long as you have a good master password, you can only have to remember one thing where memory is the bottleneck and have super strong passwords for everything, be able to quickly autofill, and have a good way of tracking your stuff
    - MFA
        - Where you've got sensitive stuff implement this but also have backups for things like switching your phone
