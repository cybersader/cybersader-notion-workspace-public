# The Most Offensive Con That Ever Offensived - Bypass Edition 3_13_24

# Panel Discussion

> John Strand, Ralph May, Steve Borosh, Eric Taylor, Joff Thyer, Zach Hill, Jason Blanchard, Corey Ham

- Is offensive getting harder or easier?
    - Attack surface and reach to companies (log hanging fruit) increasing, but detection capability also increasing
    - Corey Ham - Harder. More products are integrating security. Better firewalls, web apps, mobile phones, and email clients.  Complexity increase for pentesters.
    - Eric Taylor - wider spread of cloud usage and endpoint spread.  BECs a lot because pentesters can live on infra that doesn’t have good logging and auditing.
    - Pentesters make tools so that they can become irrelevant.  They make something with the goal of it being temporarily used (at least partly with the attack content).  Our job is to make our job harder
    - No one person knows the whole surface in an org.
    - Copilot AI makes post exploitation a bit easier, but not point and shoot.  Can help find emails and internal spearphishing.
- For those working incidents, what about the stale vulns? Are we preaching to the choir?
    - CISA - Jen Easterly is doing good stuff, BUT they’re putting out the same stuff like “security awareness.”  We are rebranding the same stuff when it comes to patching and awareness.
- Involving lawyers
    - BHIS has never involved when talking to their clients about vulns in their software
- How many times has BHIS got seize and desist orders?
    - twice…they don’t last long
        - They do “good faith” security research
            - definition by DoJ
            - 90 day window
            - big difference between “I found something and here’s how we can use it and we have a legal binding” AND “Yo slack or discord I found weird vuln. Look what it does to my friends as an example.”
- Red teamers and zero-day builders that define everything around building zero-days are lame.
- Offensive and defensive are both cool and they both help appreciate both sides
- DFIR is not cool.  Brought up when stuff hits the fan, they don’t generate costs, and are not always liked.  It’s cool though in reality.
- We are really all blue teamers in the end.  Red teamers tears taste the best.
- It used to be doom and gloom on the defensive side, but not really anymore.

# **Bypass Like It's 1999: Decades of Fraggles, Doozers, and Desync**

>John Askew

## 90s - The IDS Era

- Snort popular in 1998
- Zeek/Bro in 1998
- IPS in the 90s
- Garter says IDS will die by 2005

## Fraggle-Rock Show

- Little guys that make buildings out of radishes, these guys that eat the buildings, then guys that rebuild those buildings
- From one construction to another there’s desynchronization and lack of consistency between two perspectives

## Browser Development

- parsing and processing engines developed at different speeds with browsers so security was implemented better at some layers than others

## Powershell and LOLBins in the Beginning

- super wild west in the 90s
- scripting was everything here

## Fragrouter

- Getting around IDS (part of Kali) by changing packets

![Untitled](The%20Most%20Offensive%20Con%20That%20Ever%20Offensived%20-%20Bypa/Untitled%202.png)

- How to lose friends:
    - Complain about the recent campaign all the time
    - Sit in a dark room trying to replicate a PoC
- Street knowledge
    - EDR prison story
        - prisons use to throw tennis balls to smuggle drugs
        - they used a net to stop it - “thatll work right?”
        - They started using ice cubes
        - “tighter weave net” - they just used weak points in net
    - EDR is cat and mouse
- The “perfect” EDR, by the nature of computation, would brick an endpoint
- Looking for the open window
    - AMSI, PS Doangrade, payload rename and encoding
    - Block or DNS sinkhole EDR network traffic?
        - do they have offline agents?
- Don’t assume
    - Blue are not the NSA
    - Red aren’t APT groups
        - they have reduced scope, time, and increased worry over hurting your assets
- How to keep friends, colleagues, and sanity
    - Scope better, talk more, try the low hanging fruit
    - collab with blue: you aren’t adversaries
    - You don’t need PoCs.  Keep it simple stupid. The evasion and the report (and brief)
- Whose skills do you celebrate when you’re unsuccessful in engagements
    - Sad for a bit, but then move into a purple engagement

# **In Cloud We Trust: Common M365 Attack Techniques to Bypass Defenses**

>Alex Martirosyan

Ready to learn common attacks to bypass defenses in Microsoft 365? This session will explore techniques used by red teamers to achieve initial access or evade detections. The three examples we will focus on include:

- Bypassing the Microsoft Teams Splash Page
- Conducting Direct Send Phishing attacks
- Exploiting CDNs and Static Websites for abuse

The rapid adoption of cloud services has unfortunately led many organizations to trust defaults, inherit unwanted services, and misunderstand the shared responsibility model. A prime example is the widespread adoption of Microsoft 365 to support remote workforces. Hint: You get more than just Outlook and Teams…

Although these techniques are not new, the shift from on-premises to cloud infrastructure has significantly broadened the attack surface for threat actors. As a penetration tester we often times surprise our clients with these techniques. This is primarily due to a lack of awareness and information overload from how recent these bypasses are discovered. By gaining an understanding of how these bypasses work, attendees will be better equipped to strengthen their cloud defenses. Defenders attending this session will ensure their Organization is prepared for these bypasses for the next penetration test or attack!

## Outline

- Cloud Security Risks
- Bypass for MS Teams Splash page
- Abusing CDNs and static websites
- M365 mitigations

## Notes

- Entra and MS-based groups are different
- MS Teams Bypass
- It’s not a complete bypass if you leave artifacts.  It’s revasion.

# Greeting from the Red Team

>Michael Allen

[2024_03_13_Offensive-Con-2024_Michael-Allen.pdf](The%20Most%20Offensive%20Con%20That%20Ever%20Offensived%20-%20Bypa/2024_03_13_Offensive-Con-2024_Michael-Allen.pdf)

"Attack where your opponent is weakest.

Be in the place your opponent cannot see.

Do what your opponent does not expect."

These are the principles that led to the development of a wildly successful (but admittedly simple) social engineering attack that I've been using to breach customer networks during red team and phishing exercises over the last six months.

During this talk you'll learn how the attack works and why relatively simple techniques are sometimes the best at overcoming advanced defenses. I'll also share the methodology I used to increase my chances of success and make detection as difficult as possible. References will be provided for all the tools and techniques I discuss, so red teamers and pentesters will leave the talk able to perform the same attack, themselves.

Finally, I'll share some suggestions for preventing this and future attacks that side-step security products and take their victims by surprise.

- The good ol days
    - email defenses were nonexistent
    - AV was bad
    - No EDR
    - Phishing was unheard of but happened
- Common defenses today
    - Email filtering
        - domain age and rep
        - SPF, DKIM
        - Message content
    - Chat messages
        - internal only
    - Awareness
    - EDR, AV
    - Network defenses
        - egress controls
        - traffic decryption and inspection
        - web traffic filtering
    - External access controls
        - MFA
        - geolocation
- Some defenses
    - FIDO 2 MFA
    - Login only from VPN
