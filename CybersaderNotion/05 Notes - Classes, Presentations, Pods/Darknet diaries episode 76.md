- Alex Holden was interviewed by Forbes.  There was quite a bit of skepticism
- Breach had been from 420,000 different websites including email credential pairs
- This was a large chunk of the world wide web at the time
- JP Morgan spends hundreds of millions of dollars on cybersecurity alone.
- HAP Morgan analyst read this report from hold security
- Showed that a charity race sponsored by JP Morgan had been breached via the charity website
- The website was hosted by simco data systems
- Turned out Simco was mentioned in the report as well
- Looks like the hackers had stolen an SSL cert and started calling around the network
- JP Morgan started to gather IOCs from the simco bridge and using it to query their own systems for signs of compromise
- They found the same 11 IP addresses

- JP Morgan contacted the FBI and handed this data over to the financial services and information analysis sharing center - they circulate this data to banks and financial institutes
- They weren't sure how the hackers jumped from the charities website into their own servers
- It's possible the hackers attacked simco, the hosting provider, and then tried to attack hosted websites and servers from there
- Maybe they accessed creds from there
- Credential stuff with used passwords likely
- Ultimately the accurate a valid login to a JPMorgan server

- In large companies there's a lot of stale assets and technical debt.  In this case one of the old benefits servers was not updated and this server housed a lot of user data for employees
- The server definitely didn't have 2FA

- Attack on JP Morgan could have been the first phase of retaliation
- Thanks for that size experience attacks on the daily but this attack was different

- CISO resigned some time before ironically
- New security exec James Cummings was appointed in 2014
- The new security execs had a military background so there could have been some bias when claiming that the attack came from Russia
- The FBI is analysis did not line up with the analysis from Cummings and new CISO rattray
- FBI wasn't convinced that this was a threat to national security or a state sponsored attack
- Looks like they're logging systems had ran out of storage and even though the attack data was captured it wasn't retained for long enough.  This is a common issue for a company this size and it all depends on the risk appetite and how they optimize the storage and infrastructure and how much money they're willing to spend

- Assistant director of FBI had a meeting with multiple executives from JP Morgan including the security related ones
- If this attack was a matter of national security then they were not legally obligated to notify their customers of the breach
- The FBI and JP Morgan reached the truce and handed over all of the day that they had on the attack

- The private sector has more financially motivated attacks whereas the military usually has espionage related attacks
- The secret service was also involved in the investigation
- The secret service threatened to subpoena the attack data

- Hackers purposefully deleted log files that would have left the data necessary to attribute the activities on their network
