# Web-based AI Taxonomy Generator

Person:

- I want to create a web-based GUI that uses serverless functions, lots of AI, and integration with a tool like Obsidian (maybe an Obsidian plugin). I want the web GUI to take a prompt from the user to develop a taxonomy on some subject and search for solutions that can acconplish certain tasks. The taxonomy could be a nested structure or a tabular structure with bullet points or something. A web crawling bot should then do some things: 1) create search queries to look for solutions, 2) use GPT to find currently known solutions, 3) search for alternatives to the current solutions, but ultimately 4) the system should allow the user to easily create expansion prompts. An example of an expansion prompt would be the "alternatives to" example. The web crawler should then find as many solutions as possible and use AI to look at the page to determine if the solution applies, and if it does to feed the data into an AI model that would be used to create the taxonomy. The whole point of this is to tell a bot to go find solutions for a problem and then it goes to look for solutions and curates them. Give me tools tech, and a tech stack or architecture for making it work. Include all of the necessary code if possible

- Creating a web-based GUI with serverless functions, AI, and integration with a tool like Obsidian requires a combination of multiple tools and technologies. Here's a high-level tech stack and architecture for your project:
1. Frontend (Web-based GUI):
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript for building the basic structure, styles, and interactivity
- Frameworks like React, Vue.js, or Angular for managing UI components and state
1. Backend:
- Serverless functions using AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, or Google Cloud Functions
- API Gateway for managing and routing requests to serverless functions
1. AI and Machine Learning:
- OpenAI API (GPT) for text generation and understanding
- Web crawling using Scrapy, Beautiful Soup, or Selenium
- TensorFlow or PyTorch for creating and training custom models
1. Integration with Obsidian or similar tools:
- Obsidian plugin development or Obsidian API for creating custom plugins
- RESTful API or GraphQL for connecting the frontend and backend

To achieve the desired functionality, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a frontend application using your preferred JavaScript framework (React, Vue.js, Angular) and design the UI for user input and displaying the taxonomy.
2. Set up serverless functions for different tasks, such as receiving prompts, managing taxonomy data, interacting with AI models, and searching for solutions.
3. Use the OpenAI API to interact with GPT for generating and understanding text, and create a custom model if needed.
4. Implement a web-crawler with Scrapy or Beautiful Soup to search for solutions and alternatives based on the user input.
5. Use AI models to analyze and filter relevant information from the crawled web pages.
6. Develop an Obsidian plugin or use the Obsidian API to integrate the functionality with the Obsidian tool.

Due to the complexity of this project, providing all the necessary code in this response is not feasible. However, here's a high-level outline of how the code structure would look:

- Frontend:
- Components for user input, taxonomy display, and expansion prompts
- API calls to interact with the backend
- Backend (serverless functions):
- Function to receive and process user input
- Function to manage taxonomy data
- Function to interact with AI models and web-crawlers
- AI and Machine Learning:
- Code to interact with OpenAI API and GPT
- Custom models (if needed) built with TensorFlow or PyTorch
- Web-crawling script using Scrapy or Beautiful Soup
- Obsidian Integration:
- Obsidian plugin code or API calls to integrate with Obsidian

Remember that this is just a high-level architecture and tech stack. You'll need to go deeper into each of these areas and tools to build the desired functionality.

Person:

- Give me an outline or data flow that starts from user input and goes throughs the pieces of the workflow. I want to know the best AI to use for each piece and how i could process text of certain pieces. Think of this like peaudocode. For instance, I want to know how I will crawl website to figure out if its a solution (is there a confidence value generated), I want to know how exactly the data will be fed into gpt to generate the taxonomy when the text is very long, i want to know what serverless tech i can use, i want to know how ill get around bot protections on website, etc.

ChatGPT:

- Here's a pseudocode-style outline of the data flow, starting from user input and going through the workflow. This outline includes the AI technologies and techniques to be used at each stage:
1. User inputs a problem or prompt in the frontend (Web-based GUI).
2. The frontend sends the prompt to the backend through an API call (e.g., REST or GraphQL).
3. Backend (using serverless functions, e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, or Google Cloud Functions):
a. Receives and processes the user input.
b. Generates search queries based on the input using GPT (OpenAI API) or a custom NLP model.
4. Backend triggers a web-crawler (e.g., Scrapy, Beautiful Soup, or Selenium) to:
a. Search for solutions based on generated search queries.
b. Crawl websites and extract relevant information.

Note: To bypass bot protections, consider using techniques such as rotating user agents, using proxies, and limiting the request rate.
5. Backend processes crawled data:
a. Use AI models (e.g., GPT or custom NLP models) to analyze and filter relevant information from the extracted text.
b. Assign a confidence score to each solution based on the analysis (e.g., using text similarity or classification algorithms).

Note: For long text, consider using techniques such as summarization or breaking the text into smaller chunks before processing with AI models.
6. Backend generates the taxonomy:
a. Feed relevant data into GPT or a custom model to generate the taxonomy structure.
b. Store the taxonomy in a database or in-memory storage (e.g., Redis).
7. Backend sends the generated taxonomy to the frontend.
8. Frontend displays the taxonomy to the user:
a. User can create expansion prompts.
b. Expansion prompts are sent back to the backend to repeat steps 3-7, refining the taxonomy.
9. If integrated with Obsidian or a similar tool, sync the generated taxonomy with the tool using Obsidian plugin development or API.

This outline provides a general idea of the data flow and AI technologies to be used at each stage. You'll need to dive deeper into each technology and explore specific implementation details based on the chosen tech stack and AI models.
