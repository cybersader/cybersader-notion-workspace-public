# Auto editing with voice

Person:

- I want to make an application that can use OBS or another screen recording application to auto cut and organize video clips. Optionally it could use Sharex. Here's what I want it to do. I want to use the mic and voice AI to start and stop recording. It would be cool too if you could give commands like "retry" or "cut everything before this" and it would cut that part of the video out. It would then take the resulting video and organize it into a folder. How could I go about doing this in a simple manner and have it be something thta can run on the desktop?

ChatGPT:

- Building an application that can use screen recording software and voice recognition to automate video editing is a complex task, but it can be broken down into several components. Here are the steps you could follow to build this application:
1. Choose a programming language: You'll need to choose a programming language that you're comfortable with and that can interact with the tools you'll be using. Python is a popular choice for this type of application because of its rich library support and ease of use.
2. Choose a screen recording software: OBS is a great choice because it's free, open-source, and widely used. It has an API that you can use to control it programmatically.
3. Choose a voice recognition software: There are many options available for voice recognition, including Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, Amazon Transcribe, and Microsoft Azure Speech-to-Text. Choose the one that works best for your needs and budget.
4. Set up the voice recognition: You'll need to set up the voice recognition software to listen to your microphone and recognize the commands you want to use. You'll also need to define the commands and what actions they should trigger.
5. Set up the screen recording: You'll need to use the OBS API to control the screen recording, including starting and stopping it, and cutting the video at specific points. You'll also need to define where the video should be saved.
6. Create the video organization system: Once the video is recorded and cut, you'll need to organize it into a folder. You can use a file system library to create the folders and move the video files into them.
7. Test and refine: As you build your application, test it frequently and refine it to improve its performance and functionality.

Building an application like this can be a significant undertaking, but it's also a great opportunity to learn new skills and create something unique. Good luck!

Person:

- Could I say things like "record this window"? Could I optionally use Sharex?

ChatGPT:

- Yes, you could add functionality to your application to allow users to specify which window or application they want to record. To do this, you could use a window capture library like pywin32 or PyAutoGUI to capture the screen and then use the OBS API to set up a scene or source for that window.

Regarding ShareX, you could use it as an alternative to OBS for capturing the screen, but it doesn't have a public API that you could use to interact with it programmatically. However, ShareX does have a feature to run custom commands after capturing an image or recording a video. You could use this feature to trigger your application after a capture is made, and your application could then process the recorded video or image.

Person:

- Give me a general architecture or stack for this application and include options for each part. Then, if possible, make mermaid code (just the textual code) that could represent this tech stack for a desktop app with all of this functionality and include interactions with API and other components or libraries

ChatGPT:

- Sure, here's a possible tech stack and architecture for the application you described:

Tech stack:

- Programming language: Python
- Screen recording software: OBS Studio
- Voice recognition software: Google Cloud Speech-to-Text
- GUI framework: PyQt or Tkinter
- Video processing library: moviepy
- File system library: os or pathlib

Architecture:

```
User interacts with GUI -> GUI sends commands to controller -> Controller interacts with OBS and speech-to-text API -> Record and edit video -> Save processed video to file system

```

Here's the Mermaid code for the tech stack:

```
graph LR
A((User interacts with GUI))
A --> B(Controller)
B --> C(OBS)
B --> D(Speech-to-text API)
B --> E(moviepy)
E --> F(File system library)

```

In this architecture, the user interacts with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using a framework like PyQt or Tkinter. The GUI sends commands to the controller, which interacts with OBS to control the screen recording, and with the speech-to-text API to recognize voice commands. The video is edited using the moviepy library and then saved to the file system using a file system library like os or pathlib.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

Person:

- The hardest part, I think, could potentially be transcribing the video so it can decide to delete or modify the video based on commands like "forget the last clip", "or delete before this part." For instance saying "delete before I started talking about this", would have AI yhat not only transcribed the video, but there would be NLP AI to recognize the start and stop of certain sections and recognize what part you were talking about based on context

ChatGPT:

- Yes, transcribing the video and recognizing spoken commands can be challenging. You would need to use a speech-to-text API that can transcribe the video and then use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract meaning from the transcription and recognize spoken commands.

Here's a possible architecture for this functionality:

```
User interacts with GUI -> GUI sends commands to controller -> Controller interacts with OBS and speech-to-text API -> Record and edit video -> Transcribe video -> NLP processing -> Edit video based on spoken commands -> Save processed video to file system

```

Here, the controller not only interacts with OBS and the speech-to-text API, but also with an NLP processing module that can recognize spoken commands and extract meaning from the transcription. You could use a library like spaCy or NLTK to perform the NLP processing.

To recognize spoken commands, you would need to define a set of commands and their associated actions, and then train an NLP model to recognize those commands. For example, you could define a command like "delete the last clip" and train the NLP model to recognize that command and trigger the video editing code to delete the last clip.

Here's the updated Mermaid code:

```
graph LR
A((User interacts with GUI))
A --> B(Controller)
B --> C(OBS)
B --> D(Speech-to-text API)
B --> E(moviepy)
E --> G(Transcription)
G --> H(NLP processing)
H --> E
H --> F(Edit video based on spoken commands)
F --> E
F --> I(File system library)

```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

Person:

- Would it be possible to give a GPT model programmatic access to edit the video and decide what to do based on user commands? In other words, there would only be examples of what to tell the AI to do, but the GPT model would decide what commands to input. Also, the GPT model would understand the potential commands or instantiations it could make to some custom video editing api or one you mentioned. For example, the GPT model would know that it can delete and trim use the clips times. The GPT model would also somehow have access to a transcribed version of the video. Not sure how any of this would be possible honestly.

ChatGPT:

- It is possible to use a GPT model to recognize spoken commands and generate instructions for editing the video. However, it would be challenging to give the GPT model programmatic access to edit the video directly.

One approach could be to have the GPT model generate a text-based script or set of instructions for the video editing code to execute. The GPT model could recognize spoken commands, understand the potential actions that can be taken using the video editing API, and generate instructions that would be executed by the video editing code.

To do this, you would need to first transcribe the video using a speech-to-text API, and then feed the transcription into the GPT model. The GPT model could then recognize spoken commands and generate instructions based on the commands and the transcription. The video editing code would then execute the instructions generated by the GPT model.

Here's a possible architecture for this functionality:

```
User interacts with GUI -> GUI sends commands to controller -> Controller interacts with OBS and speech-to-text API -> Record and edit video -> Transcribe video -> GPT model generates instructions for video editing -> Execute instructions -> Save processed video to file system

```

In this architecture, the controller interacts with OBS and the speech-to-text API, as well as a GPT model. The GPT model generates instructions for video editing, which are executed by the video editing code.

While this approach is technically possible, it would require a significant amount of development work to train and integrate the GPT model, as well as to build the text-based scripting system for the video editing code to execute. Additionally, the accuracy and performance of the GPT model may be limited by the quality of the transcription and the complexity of the spoken commands.

Person:

- How would timestamps work with transcription for this use case?

ChatGPT:

- Timestamps can be very useful when working with video transcriptions because they allow you to map the spoken words to specific points in time within the video. This can be helpful for a number of reasons, such as when you need to search for a particular section of the video, or when you need to synchronize the transcript with the video for captioning or subtitling.

When using a speech-to-text API to transcribe the video, the API will typically provide timestamps for each word or phrase in the transcription. These timestamps can be used to map the spoken words to specific points in time within the video.

One approach could be to use the timestamps provided by the speech-to-text API to create a timestamped transcript that includes the spoken words and their corresponding timestamps. You could then use this timestamped transcript to allow users to search for specific sections of the video, or to allow the GPT model to generate instructions based on the specific timestamps of certain words or phrases.

For example, if a user says "delete everything before this timestamp", you could use the timestamped transcript to find the corresponding point in the video and delete everything before that point.

In summary, timestamps can be very useful when working with video transcriptions, and can be used to map spoken words to specific points in time within the video.

Person:

- How would I organize videos into projects? My idea is that you could say "start a project" which would essentially mean start making a video, but it wouldnt record. Then, you say "record clip for some seconds" or "start clip" or "start clip in 3 seconds", and you could say "forget that clip to delete the last one." At the end, all of the clips are combined. How would I do this?

ChatGPT:

- To organize videos into projects, you could create a data model that represents a video project and its associated video clips. The data model could include information such as the project name, the date and time of creation, and the list of video clips that belong to the project.

When the user starts a new project, you could create a new instance of the project data model and begin adding video clips to it. When the user records a new clip, you could create a new instance of a video clip data model, which would include information such as the start and end times of the clip, and the filename of the video file.

Here's a possible data model for a video project:

```
Project
- name: string
- date_created: datetime
- video_clips: List[VideoClip]

VideoClip
- filename: string
- start_time: float
- end_time: float

```

To implement the "start clip" and "start clip in X seconds" functionality, you could use the OBS API to start and stop the screen recording. When the user starts a new clip, you would start the screen recording and record the clip for the specified duration or until the user stops the recording.

To implement the "forget that clip" functionality, you would simply delete the most recent video clip from the project's list of video clips.

Once the user has recorded all the necessary video clips for the project, you could use a video processing library like moviepy to combine the video clips into a single video file. The resulting video file could then be saved to the file system or uploaded to a cloud service.

Overall, organizing videos into projects requires a bit of data modeling and careful management of the video clips. But with the right tools and techniques, it's definitely possible to build a user-friendly and efficient video editing workflow.
