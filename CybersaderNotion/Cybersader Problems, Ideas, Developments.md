- Api based password strength and verifier middleware
- Honeypot cloud business that pays people to host honeypot for large scale cyber analytics, but also shares attack stats with them.  A model that would help everyone in the process, but be difficult to implement.
- Benmap - hosted and selected serverless proxy enabled nmap powered service. Means I don’t have to manage the infrastructure, but allow people to easily deploy their own serverless stuff with one-click, so that they only pay for what they use. However I need a system that forces them to atleast pay me one dollar to use the service.
- Figure out how to outsource AV or IDS or detection with homomorphic encryption
- Physical Hone Security
- Advanced Keylogger Business
    - Monetization - uses analytics for lower levels of monetization and subscriptions for higher levels. It would use the deidentified and secure analytics of users to collab and share with 3rd parties that pay for the reports, analytics, or information about certain topics
    - This keylogger could be used as an engine but the primary use would be to detect unwanted activity with certain applications
        - Pornography use
        - Talking about inappropriate topics
        - Protecting from certain websites, etc.
    - Tech stack
        - Homomorphic encryption used to work on client data somehow so that the user data is never revealed
        - Federated architecture to handle keys and establishing bases for data in the cloud
        - Differential Privacy to hide the identities of users and control privacy ratios enough to prevent misuse of certain data categories

- ChatGPT or GPT3 Cybersecurity Chat AI Training and Utilization
    - **GPT Utilization in Cybersecurity Problem Solving and Solution Research Approaches**. This would involve curating methods of finding solutions for various cybersecurity problems (sounds too general on the surface), but I would like to know of all of the methods for gathering knowledge about cybersecurity solutions and utilizing those solutions. All of the methods I can think of to obtain knowledge are as follows: search engine queries, library archives, research papers, social media, networking with people, professional research groups like Gartner and Forrester, and then AI-based knowledge curation through GPT models. I would like to look at a potential method of creating organization and industry specific GPT models that help security operation centers with their day-to-day operations. This would mean potentially creating an example process for creating a specialized chatbot, then utilizing it and evaluating results.
- Geolocation Attribution Methods in Cybersecurity
    - **Geolocation Attribution Methods in Offensive and Defensive Settings**. This would look at various methods for obtaining the locations of entities in various cybersecurity and attack scenarios. This is very relevant to cyber warfare, authorities finding attacker locations, and even various commercial applications.  This would involve an exhaustive look at finding the location of entities whether they be mobile devices, simple IP devices with network adapters, and so on.

- Cybersecurity Training and Education with Traversable Scenario Graphs / Text-Based RPGs
- Centralizing Risk Visibility and Intelligence in Organizations - fuzzy matching, crowdsourced entity resolution, APIs and integrations, architectures and frameworks
- Why search engines are old and why web scraping data into prompt to response AI models is the next step
- Mobile Device Attacks by Platform
    - Literature Review of Mobile Security with Android vs IoS.  This could take an objective or subjective look at the risk for the two most popular mobile OS platforms. This could involve aggregating the sentiments of research papers on various vulnerabilities or simply do an exhaustive search of vulnerabilities over both platforms with some analysis to top it off.
- Contribution system and workflow that hooks up to Notion
- Layer 2 and Layer 3 Networking Mechanisms for Conversational Operation and Related Exploits or Weaknesses (port forwarding for L2 and IntraVLAN for layer 3)
- Caller ID Spoofing and the Crux of the Scammer Problem - How Scam Call Centers get Numbers - How people get fake numbers
- Security Survey of LLMNR
- Firewall Ruleset Analysis
    - Looking at subnets and creating DMZs and zoning based on applications
    - iptables firewall rules validator and workflow
        - can do ruleshadowing and other analysis like below
            1. **Inconsistent subnet space:** To identify inconsistent subnet spaces, one approach is to categorize rules by their network subnets and examine the distribution of the rules within each subnet. Any subnet with fewer rules than others may warrant a closer look to determine if the firewall rules are correctly implemented. This task could be aided with tools that support IP address management (IPAM), which often come with features to track and visualize subnets and associated firewall rules.
            2. **Identifying Zones:** Identifying zones or collections of subnets providing similar services could be done by grouping subnets based on the services (port numbers) allowed by the firewall rules. You may then analyze these groups for similarities or differences in the firewall rules applied.
            3. **Too Permissive Rules:** To identify overly permissive rules, look for those allowing access to a large number of ports or to highly sensitive ports without any constraints. This could also include rules allowing access from any source or to any destination. Rules without any logging or with weak encryption can also be considered overly permissive.
            4. **Extrapolating Larger Rules:** Identifying opportunities to consolidate rules can be a complex task, but you can start by searching for rules that are subsets of other rules. For instance, if you have a rule that allows traffic from any source to a specific destination port, and another rule that allows traffic from a specific source to the same port, the second rule is redundant and can be removed.
            5. **Duplicate Rules:** Identifying duplicate rules can be done by sorting or grouping rules based on source, destination, and service. Then, you can check each group for rules that are identical or nearly identical.
