## Company Websites

### Manually Finding Company Website Job Posts

When looking for the job postings or career pages on a company website, there are several terms and phrases you can use to try and find them:

**1.  "Careers" or "Career Opportunities"
2.  "Job Openings" or "Jobs"
3.  "Employment" or "Work with us"
4.  "Join our Team" or "Team Opportunities"
5.  "Hiring"**

These are common phrases used by companies to indicate where their job postings are located on their website.

You can also try searching using the company's name and any of the keywords like "jobs", "careers" or "job openings" and check if that brings up the career or jobs page of the company website.

### Web Scraping Job Posts & Career Pages

I’m not gonna tell you exactly how to do this, because it goes against a lot of company and website policies, but it is an option.

## Networking

LINK TO CYBER NETWORKING RESOURCES AND GETTING INVOLVED

Networking should be the preferred method for finding a job. 

**1.  Job openings are not always advertised**: Many job openings are not advertised to the public and are filled through internal referrals or through the company's network. By networking with professionals in the field, you may be able to learn about job openings before they are made public.

**2.  Personal connections can be valuable**: Building personal connections with professionals in the field can increase your visibility and make it more likely that you will be considered for job openings. Employers are more likely to hire people they know or who have been recommended by someone they trust.

**3.  Networking can help you learn about new opportunities:** You will be more informed about what is happening in the industry and that will help you to target your job search in a specific way.

**4.  Networking can help you learn about the company culture:** Networking with professionals who already work for a company can give you insight into the company's culture, which can help you determine if it would be a good fit for you. 

**5.  Networking can help you learn about the required skills:** Networking with professionals in the field can also help you learn about the specific skills and qualifications that are in demand, and help you tailor your resume and interview to match those requirements.

You can join online groups or attend industry events, this way you will have more chances to meet and connect with people who can help you in your job search.
