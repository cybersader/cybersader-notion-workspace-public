# URL to Link Curation Apps & Solutions

**Overview:**

Link farms or collections of links are an essential tool for businesses, content creators, and social media influencers to direct their followers to multiple links at once. There are several solutions available that provide similar functionality, including custom domain options that use JAMstack and Netlify, Webflow templates, Bookmark or start pages, and other link in bio solutions.

At the core of all these solutions is the ability to attach a URL to a collection of links or bookmarks. This means users can share these link farms with their audience on various platforms, including social media profiles, email newsletters, and personal websites.
